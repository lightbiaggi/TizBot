Second, we \\nassess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some \\ncountries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services, \\nimplementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the \\nsalience of mental health. Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental \\nhealth, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow \\nbiomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and \\nresearch. Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with \\na focus on key strategies; notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing \\naccess to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health \\ntasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children \\nand people with substance use disorders. Our recommendations are relevant for the mental health of populations \\nand functioning of health systems in not only LMICs but also high-income countries impacted by the COVID-19 \\npandemic, with wide disparities in quality of and access to mental health care.\\n536\\t\\nwww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   June 2021\\nReview\\nDepartment of Global Health \\nand Social Medicine, Harvard \\nMedical School, Boston, \\nMA, USA (J A Naslund PhD, \\nD B Machado, V Patel PhD); \\n \\nGlobal Health Department, \\nHealth Services Academy, \\nIslamabad, Pakistan \\n(S Sikander PhD); Department of \\nPrimary Care and Mental \\nHealth, University of Liverpool, \\nLiverpool, UK (S Sikander); \\nWellcome–DBT India Alliance, \\nSangath, New Delhi, India \\n(P Gonsalves MSc, V Patel); \\nSangath, India (M Balaji MSc); \\nDivision of Epidemiology and \\nPsychosocial Research, National \\nInstitute of Psychiatry Ramón \\nde la Fuente Muñiz, \\nMexico City, Mexico \\n(C Benjet PhD); The Reference \\nCentre for Psychosocial \\nSupport, International \\nFederation of the Red Cross and \\nRed Crescent, Hong Kong \\nSpecial Administrative Region, \\nChina (E Y L Cheung PhD); \\nThe Red Cross of the Hong Kong \\nSpecial Administrative Region \\nof China, Hong Kong Special \\nAdministrative Region, China \\n(E Y L Cheung); CBM Global and \\nCentre for Global Mental \\nHealth, London, UK \\n(J Eaton MBBS); School of \\nPsychology, University of \\nSussex, Brighton, UK \\n(P Gonsalves); Department of \\nObstetrics, Gynecology and \\nReproductive Biology, College \\nof Human Medicine, Michigan \\nState University, East Lansing, \\nMI, USA (M Hailemariam PhD); \\nTranscultural Psychosocial \\nOrganization Nepal, \\nKathmandu, Nepal \\n(N P Luitel MPhil); Centre for \\nData and Knowledge \\nIntegration for Health, CIDACS–\\nFIOCRUZ, Bahia, Brazil \\n(D B Machado PhD); Mental \\nHealth Service Users \\nAssociation Ethiopia, Addis \\nAbaba, Ethiopia \\n(E Misganaw MA); Global \\nMental Health Peer Network, \\nPretoria, South Africa \\n(E Misganaw); Pravara Institute \\nof Medical Sciences, Loni, India \\n(R Shidhaye PhD); Global Mental \\nHealth Peer Network, \\nJohannesburg, South Africa \\n(C Sunkel); Mentally Aware \\nNigeria Initiative, Lagos, \\nNigeria (V Ugo MBBS); United \\nfor Global Mental Health, \\nLondon, UK (V Ugo); Centre for \\nRural Health, College of Health \\nSciences, University of \\nKwaZulu-Natal, Durban, \\nmental health systems. Although our concerns begin \\nwith a focus on LMICs, the pandemic has shown the \\nprofoundly interconnected nature of global health and \\nthe opportunities for experiences and knowledge to \\ninform the mental health response in all countries.\\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic is still unfolding at the \\ntime of writing, and much of the research on mental \\nhealth concerns is ongoing, this Review seeks to provide \\na narrative overview of some prominent findings to date. \\nWe also attempt to look into the future to anticipate the \\npotential longer-term mental health effects that will \\nemerge in the aftermath of the health, economic, and \\nsocial consequences of the pandemic.\\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on \\nmental health\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the already large \\ntreatment gap in mental health across LMICs, and \\nthreatens to widen it. New demands for mental health \\ncare in these countries intersect with fragile health \\nsystems, scarce resources and workforce capacity, social \\nunrest and violence in response to COVID-19 contain\\xad\\nment strategies, and overall scarce and inequitable access \\nto evidence-based interventions.10–12 It can be speculated \\nthat the long-term consequences on mental health will \\nbe particularly severe in the lowest resourced and most \\nimpoverished regions of the globe, where there was \\nvirtually no access to mental health services before the \\npandemic.13\\nImmediate impacts\\nEmerging reports on the impacts of the COVID-19 \\npandemic on mental health have primarily documented \\nthe increase in symptoms of mental health distress, \\nwhich might reflect a normative response to the \\nextraordinary uncertainties and difficulties experienced \\nby populations. For example, reports have documented \\nincreased prevalence of psychological distress among \\nhealth-care staff,14,15 associated with stigma and fear of \\nthe disease.16 That said, these reports could also imply a \\nshifting of the population distribution of distress and a \\nconsequent increase in the prevalence of clinically \\nsignificant mental health problems. This theory is \\ncongruent with the few studies on the prevalence of \\nmental health disorders that we have identified. \\nFor example, a nationwide online study of more \\nthan 10\\u2009000 individuals in Bangladesh reported a \\n33% prevalence of depression and 5% prevalence of \\nsuicidal ideation.17 Thus, recognising acute stress \\nresponses is essential for preventive interventions to \\nreduce the incidence of clinically significant conditions \\nand to build systems that address the rising needs for \\nmental health care.\\nIn LMICs worldwide, population-wide distress can be \\nattributed to continued uncertainties about the spread of \\nthe disease, the effectiveness of containment strategies, \\nand when and how everyday life will return to some \\nresemblance of familiarity.18 These experiences of distress \\nare exacerbated by actions aimed at mitigating the spread \\nof COVID-19, in which governments in many LMICs \\nhave implemented strict measures (eg, use of lockdowns). \\nThese measures and related policy decisions have had \\nunprecedented effects on the economic and social sectors \\nin countries where the vast majority of people are \\nemployed in the informal labour market and where \\nthreats to their livelihood are already leading to public \\nresistance and, sometimes, violence.13,19 For instance, use \\nof force by law enforcement and the authorities has been \\nreported in several countries.20–23 There have been reports \\nof violence, arrests, and the abduction of journalists \\nand activists documenting questionable government \\npolicies, corruption, and mismanagement in response to \\nCOVID-19.20,24,25 The pandemic is also exposing the fact \\nthat particular vulnerable groups, such as prisoners, \\npatients in psychiatric hospitals or social care homes, \\npeople with disabilities, or women experiencing domestic \\nviolence or abuse, might be at even greater risk of \\npsychological distress because pre-existing failures in \\nhuman rights protection are worsened,21,26 further \\ncomplicating other mental health consequences related \\nto COVID-19.14,15\\nThreats of the pandemic towards mental health can be \\nobserved by systemic social inequities across demo\\xad\\ngraphic (eg, age, ethnicity, caste, religion, gender), \\neconomic (eg, income, assets, unemployment), neigh\\xad\\nbourhood (eg, housing structure or overcrowding), and \\nsociocultural (eg, social support, social capital, edu\\xad\\ncation) characteristics.19,27,28 In high-income settings, low \\neducational levels and indices of economic and social \\ndisadvantage, such as poor or overcrowded housing and \\nhomelessness, unemployment, social isolation, and \\nloneliness, are important risk factors for contracting \\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \\n(SARS-CoV-2).29,30 As poverty and socio\\xad\\neconomic ineq\\xad\\nuities are prominent in LMICs, and with poor coverage \\nof adequately resourced health-care and social safety \\nnets, it is plausible to expect mental health problems in \\nlarge sections of communities across LMICs. For \\nexample, this pattern is already apparent in Brazil where \\nthe greatest risk of disease transmission is among the \\npoorest communities in the country.31\\nOlder populations are among the most affected by the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic in terms of illness severity and \\nmortality. They are also more likely to suffer psychological \\nimpacts due to isolation, which is complicated by \\npre-existing physical health problems and medical \\ncomorbidities, and reduced access to care.32,33 Additionally, \\nlockdowns and the diversion of all health-care services to \\nCOVID-19 control and care affects people living with \\nserious mental illnesses, for whom access to mental \\nhealth care has been hindered during the pandemic.34 \\nTherefore, COVID-19 is likely to lead to the recurrence or \\nworsening of disorders among this group, who are also \\nmore likely to have other risk factors.\\nwww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   June 2021\\t\\n537\\nReview\\nSouth Africa \\n(A J van Rensburg PhD); Centre \\nfor Health Systems Research \\nand Development, Faculty of \\nHumanities, University of the \\nFree State, Bloemfontein, \\nSouth Africa (A J van Rensburg); \\nCentre for Mental Health Law \\nand Policy, Indian Law Society, \\nPune, India (S Pathare PhD); \\nDepartment of Global Health \\nand Population, Harvard \\nT H Chan School of Public \\nHealth, Boston, MA, USA \\n(S Saxena MD)\\nCorrespondence to:\\nDr Lola Kola, Department of \\nPsychiatry, College of Medicine, \\nUniversity of Ibadan, \\nIbadan PMB 5116, Nigeria\\nlola_kola2004@yahoo.com\\nAnother particularly vulnerable group are front-line \\nhealth workers who have been deployed and redeployed \\nfor various tasks to try to contain the pandemic.35,36 Risk \\nfactors include settings where many health workers have \\ninadequate personal protective equipment, experiencing \\nstigma and discrimination because of their profession, \\npersonal fears of infecting their families and loved ones, \\nisolation from family members, and being quarantined.37,38 \\nMental health effects of the pandemic among health \\nworkers have also manifested as experiences of trauma \\nand confusion, especially in the context of lack of clarity \\non how to effectively treat patients with COVID-19.39–41\\nLong-term impacts\\nWithout massive global action, the COVID-19 pandemic \\nis expected to have worldwide negative impacts on \\neconomic and other social determinants of health in \\nthe long term. Mental health conditions most \\nsusceptible to negative social determinants include \\nanxiety, mood, and disorders related to trauma and \\nstress, which are already leading contributors to \\ndisability worldwide, according to the Global Burden of \\nDisease study.42 The pandemic is laying the foundations \\nfor a potential worldwide suicide increase as a result of \\nincreased exposure to known risk factors, such as \\neconomic stress, job insecurity and unemployment, \\nsocial isolation, decreased access to community \\nsupport, barriers to mental health treatment, and \\nexacerbated physical health problems, especially among \\nolder adults.33,39,43 A model combining data from \\nmultiple countries, including both HICs and LMICs, \\nsuggests that job losses due to COVID-19 might result \\nin up to 9570 additional suicides per year worldwide.43 \\nTime-trend regression models following the pandemic \\nin the USA showed a forecast of 3235 excess suicides \\nover 2 years attributable to the economic downturn \\n(3·3% increase per year) if the unemployment increase \\nis moderated, and an 8164 excess suicides over 2 years \\n(8·4% increase per year) if the increase is extreme.44\\nNo such models currently exist for LMICs. However, \\ngiven that LMICs bear the bulk of the global burden of \\nsuicide45 and are especially vulnerable to economic \\ndevastation from the pandemic, it can be speculated that \\nsuicide rates could increase markedly in these countries. \\nThis theory is supported by a review of Indian media on \\nCOVID-19 and suicide.46 One concern is that in many \\nLMICs, suicides often go under-reported or are reported \\nas different causes of death due to the associated stigma, \\nas well as other cultural or religious considerations.47,48 \\nTherefore, it will be essential to ensure transparent and \\nrigorous reporting and monitoring of suicides in the \\nmonths and years ahead, not only to fully ascertain the \\nimpacts of the pandemic but also to identify whether \\nthere are regional differences in suicide rates and to \\ndevelop responses to mitigate these risk factors. Similarly, \\nsubstance use disorders represent another major cause \\nof mortality associated with previous global recessions, \\nleading to a rise in so-called deaths of despair in affected \\ncommunities.49\\nProlonged school closures are likely to have a profound \\neffect on the mental health of children, adolescents, and \\nyoung adults globally.50 Aside from the important \\nacademic benefits of schooling, schools have an essential \\nrole in shaping the mental wellbeing of young people by \\nproviding a structured and supervised space for \\nsocioemotional development, friendship and social \\nsupport networks, protection from risk-taking behav\\xad\\niours and exploitative labour, delays to early marriage \\nand childbearing, and gatekeeper services to detect and \\nintervene early to reduce child abuse. Furthermore, \\nschools often represent a key access point for food for \\nchildren in many LMICs.51 School meal and feeding \\nprogrammes are essential for ensuring sufficient \\nnutrition while promoting academic performance and \\ncognitive development.52,53 Therefore, the school closures \\nin response to the pandemic might have the unintended \\nconsequence of increasing food insecurity among \\nchildren,54 which negatively affects mental health.\\nThe response to mental health needs\\nTo date, there is little evidence on the impact of mental \\nhealth programmes for multiple reasons: the COVID-19 \\npandemic is still progressing in many countries, most \\nprogrammes are being implemented under real-world \\npublic health emergency circumstances with no \\nresources for evaluation, and there has been insufficient \\ntime since the onset of the pandemic to complete and \\npublish comprehensive evaluations. Thus, the purpose \\nof this section is to highlight the variety and inno\\xad\\nvativeness of programmes that have been initiated. The \\ninitiative and ability of governments in LMICs to develop \\nCOVID-19 mental health plans is in itself an important \\nobservation. Similarly, the ability to launch and \\nimplement diverse programmes addressing population-\\nlevel and individual clinical needs offers lessons about \\nimplementation, even if claims about effectiveness \\ncannot yet be made for most of these initiatives. Going \\nforward, it will be important to evaluate implementation \\nprocesses and outcomes, not least to inform the mental \\nhealth response to future public health emergencies, \\nsuch as the extent to which the shift of care delivery from \\nin-person to remote addresses individual clinical needs \\nequitably or the extent to which low-cost positive \\npsychology approaches adequately address population \\nmental health needs.\\nPopulation initiatives\\nSince the start of the pandemic, there have been growing \\nefforts to develop international guidance, national \\npolicies, and resources for LMICs to address mental \\nhealth and psychosocial support (MHPSS) needs \\n(figure 1).55–74 In February, 2020, the Inter-Agency Standing \\nCommittee, which coordinates responses to humanitarian \\nemergencies, issued one of the first briefing notes with \\n538\\t\\nwww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   June 2021\\nReview\\nMHPSS recommendations for COVID-19.55 The brief \\nhighlighted approaches for specific populations, such as \\nolder people, children, front-line workers, and individuals \\nin quarantine, as well as guidance on combating stigma. \\nShortly after this event, the International Federation of \\nthe Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) called \\nfor widespread use of psychological first aid, including \\nremote delivery to people in quarantine, health workers, \\nand groups with previous vulnerabilities (eg, mental and \\nsubstance use disorders).75 The International Organization \\nfor Migration provided guidelines for forced and labour \\nmigrants.59 The Africa Centres for Disease Control and \\nPrevention also released guidelines on MHPSS for \\nCOVID-19.71 In May, 2020, the UN released a policy brief \\nthat synthesised and added political weight to these \\nrecommendations.70\\nMany of the guidelines in response to COVID-19 were \\ngrounded in pre-COVID-19 approaches to MHPSS in \\nhumanitarian settings, and the experience of imple\\xad\\nmenting MHPSS services in LMICs.76–78 Notable among \\nthese are Inter-Agency Standing Committee MHPSS \\nguidelines published in 2007,64 which have been \\ncontinually revised and supplemented with additional \\nguidance. These guidelines are organised as a pyramid \\nof services with four layers: basic services and \\nsecu\\xad\\nrity, strengthening community and family, focused \\nnon-specialised supports, and specialised services.79 \\nFurthermore, many LMICs have gained considerable \\nexpertise in addressing MHPSS in response to \\nhumanitarian emergencies,80,81 and there is emerging \\nconsensus on the central principles for supporting \\nindividuals in such contexts. Some of these principles \\ninclude the recommendations by Hobfoll and colleagues,82 \\nwhich address five domains: safety, calm, self-efficacy and \\ncommunity efficacy, connectedness, and hope.\\nTherefore, on the basis of previous humanitarian \\nemergencies and the unique needs of the COVID-19 \\npandemic, many LMICs rapidly developed COVID-19 \\nnational MHPSS response plans. The National Health \\nCommission of China developed guidelines on emer\\xad\\ngency psychological crisis intervention, emphasising \\nthat mental health services should be organised at city, \\nmunicipal, and provincial levels, and included psy\\xad\\nchological outreach teams and hotlines.57 In March, 2020, \\nLebanon issued a government action plan for a \\nMHPSS response, outlining mental health promotion \\nand mitigation of COVID-19 related stres\\xad\\nsors, support \\nfor people in quarantine and front-line workers, and \\ncontinuity of services for patients with pre-existing \\nmental illness.61 Similar national action plans were \\nreleased \\nin \\nSouth \\nAfrica,62 \\nKenya,63 \\nUganda,64 \\nthe Maldives,65 and India.66 Some regional responses \\nwithin countries preceded national plans. For example, \\nthe Kerala State Government in India constituted a \\nmultidisciplinary team in February, 2020, which \\nintegrated efforts by several sectors and established a \\nstate helpline.83\\nMaterials have been developed in many LMICs to \\npromote self-help for stress management during the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic and beyond. WHO developed Doing \\nwhat matters in times of stress: an illustrated guide.67 The \\nstress management self-help techniques can be practised \\nwith just a few minutes each day and include \\naccompanying audio exercises. Released originally in \\nEnglish, with other translations underway, the guide is \\nfreely available for use and adaptation, and can be offered \\nas guided or unguided self-help. In India, Firework, a \\nshort-format, 30-second, decentralised video platform \\nthat began in 2019, launched #sparkthejoy, a social \\nimpact campaign that encourages people to do an “act of \\ngood”.84 Use of the platform doubled during the period \\nbetween lockdowns in India from the beginning of \\nMarch to the end of May, 2020.85 The Mental Health \\nInnovation Network and WHO launched Stories from the \\nfield: providing mental health and psychosocial support \\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic69 to share MHPSS \\ninnovation and best practice through personal narratives \\nfrom \\nhealth-care \\nworkers \\nworldwide. Information, \\neducation, and communication materials highlighting \\nmental health and stigma have been produced by many \\ninstitutions and organisations implementing or sup\\xad\\nporting responses in LMICs, such as the IFRC Reference \\nCentre for Psychosocial Support. In China, mental health \\neducation materials were produced and disseminated \\nFor more on the IFRC \\nPsychosocial Support Centre \\nsee https://pscentre.org\\nFigure 1: Timeline of mental health and psychosocial support guidance, policies, and resources in LMICs \\nduring the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic \\nIASC=Inter-Agency Standing Committee.

There is a debate regarding \\nthe ethics of forced abstinence.95\\nFace-to-face services have been maintained in parts of \\nsome LMICs, indicating considerable variability in the \\nresponse of the mental health-care system.96 For example, \\nin Punjab, India, opioid drug replacement therapy was \\nsuccessfully implemented.97 In Brazil, a hybrid model of \\nin-person and remote services was instituted for \\nindividuals with psychotic disorders, including depot \\nantipsychotic injections delivered during in-home visits, \\nin which food insecurity was monitored.98 A similar \\nmodel of home visits for patients with severe mental \\nillness is ongoing in Uganda amid the pandemic.99\\nFurthermore, governments, health-care providers, and \\nother institutions in many LMICs have adapted to the \\nchallenges imposed by physical distancing, disrupted \\npublic transportation, and lockdowns by shifting to \\nremote services, ranging from suicide and mental health \\nhelplines, to voice-only phone-based services, to video \\nservices over smartphones or other digital devices. To \\nhelp promote public mental health during the COVID-19 \\npandemic, the Indonesian Government, through the \\nMinistry of Health, launched Sejiwa (ie, healthy mind) as \\na counselling hotline service.100 From its launch date on \\nApril 29 to May 28, 2020, Sejiwa provided 14\\u2009916 hotline \\nconsultations with a workforce of 737 volunteer psy\\xad\\nchologists from the Indonesian Psychology Association. \\nSimilar helplines have experienced heavy use in India,101,102 \\nNigeria,103 the Philippines,104 and many other LMICs. \\nHelplines have also been used for specific populations, \\nsuch as south Asian labour migrants in Gulf countries \\nand other settings.58\\nIn the Maldives and other countries, helplines have \\nprovided psychological first aid to front-line workers.58 In \\nSouth Africa, videos were developed for health-care \\nworkers highlighting symptoms of stress, anxiety, and \\ndepression, with links to seek assistance. These videos \\nwere distributed via social media. Non\\xad\\n-governmental \\npsychology and counselling groups in the country also \\noffered free counselling via phone or Zoom to health-\\ncare workers during the height of the outbreak.105 In \\nChina, WeChat-based resources have been widely \\nestablished throughout the country to provide free, \\n24 h services, including cognitive behavioural therapy.57 \\nIn the Philippines, health-care workers and repatriated \\noverseas Filipino workers can book appointments for \\nonline or phone-based MHPSS services.104 These services \\npredominantly address general psychological distress \\nand common mental disorders, such as depression and \\nanxiety, as well as suicidality.\\nA major initiative has been building capacities among \\nnon-specialists to deliver psychological services remotely. \\nProblem Management Plus, a five-session psychological \\nintervention based on problem solving therapy and \\ndesigned for delivery by non-specialists in humanitarian \\nsettings,106 has been adapted for remote training and \\ndelivery (eg, voice-only phone or with video) by the IFRC \\nin east African countries,107 Socios en Salud in Peru, and \\nother organisations. In Peru, individuals identified to \\nhave depression with the chatbot89 are referred for remote \\nProblem Management Plus. Another problem-solving \\ntherapy, the Friendship Bench, which is delivered by \\nnon-specialists in Zimbabwe, is now being adapted for \\nonline delivery.108 Based on the large demand for \\npsychological services to be delivered remotely, WHO \\nhas adapted the Ensuring Quality in Psychological \\nSupport (EQUIP) platform.68 The result, EQUIP-remote, \\nincludes guidance on preparing for remote delivery \\n(eg, confidentiality and technology issues), delivering \\nsupervision for remote services, and managing suicidality \\nin remote delivery, as well as a competency assessment \\ntool to support safe delivery of psychological services. \\nThese recommendations are an extension of WHO’s \\noverall guidance on assuring quality and comprehensive \\ncare in the shift from in-person to remote delivery of \\nhealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic.73\\nHowever, access to these interventions is not equitably \\ndistributed. Settings with restricted phone, electricity, or \\nWiFi access cannot engage in all of these services. People \\nwith disabilities who, as well as being exposed to other \\nsocial determinants of mental ill health and exposure \\nto COVID-19, often encounter practical barriers to \\naccessing support, and many of the interventions \\ndelivered are often not accessible to those with sensory \\nimpairments.109 In relation to children and adolescents, \\nmental health care that would have otherwise been \\ndelivered via school counsellors or student health \\nservices has been disrupted as a result of school and \\nuniversity closures.50 One innovation in Pakistan has \\nbeen the launch of nationwide, free, online training \\nsessions in parent-mediated therapy to support \\nrehabilitative care of children with disabilities by \\nAga Khan University, Karachi.110\\nInfectious disease control efforts integrating mental \\nhealth principles\\nA valuable lesson learned from the Ebola virus outbreak \\nwas that MHPSS services are important not only for \\nreducing mental health problems but also for effective \\ninfectious disease control.111,112 Initial suspicion in some \\ncommunities that Ebola virus was a government \\nconspiracy led to the realisation in west Africa that \\nengagement with communities, families, and individuals \\nneeded to focus on trust building, listening skills, and \\nmanaging distress.113 Therefore, in response to the \\noutbreak, community healing dialogues were an impor\\xad\\ntant MHPSS initiative to build trust and engagement with \\npublic health recommendations for infection control.114 \\nThis response showed that MHPSS training was vital for \\ncontact tracers to build trust, support treatment \\nengagement, and recognise distress that would benefit \\nfrom mental health services.111 Thus, psychological first \\naid training is now recommended for contact tracers \\nduring infectious disease control.115 Currently, in Liberia, \\nFor more on EQUIP-remote see \\nhttps://whoequipremote.org\\nwww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   June 2021\\t\\n541\\nReview\\nhalf of the 3 day training curriculum for contact tracers in \\nthe COVID-19 response is devoted to MHPSS content.\\nDuring the Ebola virus outbreak, the IFRC advocated \\nthe five-pillar response for effective disease control: \\ncommunity engagement or social mobilisation, sur\\xad\\nveillance and contact tracing, case management and \\ntreatment, safe and dignified burials and disinfection, \\nand overall psychosocial support.

Although \\nthe framework shift that we propose is not new,119 it has not \\nyet been achieved at scale.

Some LMICs in \\nAsia and Africa have shown how the pandemic can be \\nmanaged with minimal loss of life, whereas some HICs \\nin Europe and North America have had some of the \\nhighest mortality rates in the world.120 The pandemic \\nindicates that the time has come to abandon the HIC \\nversus LMIC dichotomy, which obscures meaningful \\nvariations within and between contexts, and too often \\ncarries an implicit assumption of unidirectional learning. \\nMoving beyond these categories by thinking in terms of \\ndifferently resourced settings, we can recognise the \\ndiversity of resources including, but not limited to, \\nfinancial resources that distinguish between contexts \\nglobally and can be harnessed to face crises and improve \\nhealth. For example, religious centres, community ties, \\nfamily support structures, traditional healers, village \\nleaders, and youth groups are all contextually varying \\nresources that are essential to engage with to overcome \\nmental and physical health threats, including those of \\nCOVID-19.121–123 Compared with deficit-based assessments \\nof resources, typically defined in terms of money and \\nbiomedical \\nresources, \\nstrength-based \\nassessments \\nprovide more nuanced perspectives on the assets of \\nheterogeneous contexts and avoid the displacement of \\neffective local strategies by imported, context-free \\napproaches.121 Much can be learned from implementation \\nresearch methodologies that measure local conditions \\nand evaluate context-dependent mechanisms of change \\nwhen evaluating interventions and implementation \\nstrategies for mental health care across settings.125\\nA new architecture of global mental health is emerging, \\nwhich challenges the view that LMICs are simply data \\ncollection sites126,127 or test beds for interventions \\ndeveloped in HICs, and promotes equitable, mutually \\nbeneficial partnerships with HICs.99 Insights from \\nLMICs will be vital for promoting mental health during \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. During the short history of \\nglobal mental health, there has already been an \\ninvestment in building capacity in LMICs for research in \\nthe field.128–130 Additionally, there has been a substantial \\nincrease in research led by LMICs, and this is now \\ninfluencing the way in which mental health care is \\nenvisaged in HICs.127 However, research priorities and \\nprogrammes in global mental health are still too often \\nled by funders and academics from HICs.131,132 Research \\nfrom LMICs is valued less in terms of strength of \\nevidence and potential global impact, even when \\nobjectively \\nrated \\nas \\nhaving \\nequivalent \\nquality.133 \\nAddressing this bias requires HIC researchers, funders, \\nand journal editors to embrace a position of humility, \\nalongside challenging enduring colonial attitudes built \\ninto the education of LMIC professionals.134 In the face of \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the new norm must be mutual \\nlearning between all countries because even HICs are a \\nlong way from reaching universal and equitable coverage \\nof mental health care.\\nStakeholders: the who of global mental health\\nFor both infectious disease and mental health, public \\nhealth strategies fail when communities are not engaged \\nwith or are treated as passive recipients.135 Communities, \\nincluding families of people with mental health con\\xad\\nditions, local leadership, community health workers, and \\ntraditional and religious healers, must be empowered as \\nactive partners in delivering public health initiatives that \\nare grounded in local realities and that recognise the \\ninterdependence of mental health, physical health, and \\nsocial and economic context. Protecting mental health in \\nthe face of COVID-19 will be contingent on strategic \\ncoalitions and the development of collective pressure \\ngroups.\\nThere have been some positive steps towards increased \\ncollaboration in global mental health, including evidence \\nof effective collaboration between primary care workers \\nand traditional and faith healers.136 However, global \\nmental health advocates should become much firmer \\nin demanding participatory action to implement \\ncommunity-led responses to the mental health impact of \\nCOVID-19, by taking advantage of a global climate where \\npower structures are challenged, linking in with \\ncollective movements such as MeToo, Black Lives Matter, \\nand student-led movements against environmental \\ndegra\\xad\\ndation.137 Young people’s voices must be central to \\nPanel 1: Examples of service user partnership in the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic response\\n•\\t\\nThe Global Mental Health Peer Network, an international \\norganisation for mental health service users, partnered with \\nHuman Rights in Mental Health–Federation Global Initiative \\non Psychiatry, an international organisation that promotes \\nuser-oriented mental health services, has advocated for \\ngreater equality and equity in the pandemic response \\nthrough a joint position statement.143 \\n•\\t\\nIn a study that examined the psychosocial consequences \\nof the pandemic, the Global Mental Health Peer Network \\ncollaborated with the World Dignity Project to carry out a \\nglobal survey to ensure that the voices of people with \\nlived experience of mental health, their families, \\nand professionals who work with them are heard.144\\n•\\t\\nAs a result of amplified needs for mental health support \\ndue to the pandemic, several mental health service user \\norganisations have been involved in providing support. \\nFor example, the Psychiatric Disability Organization Kenya \\nis providing psychosocial support for prison staff in \\nNakuru working in isolation, the Zimbabwe Obsessive \\nCompulsive Disorder Trust is providing peer support \\naddressing anxiety due to COVID-19, and the Global \\nMental Health Peer Network is running online COVID-19 \\nand mental health virtual support groups twice monthly.\\nwww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   June 2021\\t\\n543\\nReview\\nthis endeavour, particularly given the potential long-\\nterm impact of the pandemic on their life chances. \\nSimilarly, the role of people with lived experience of \\nmental ill health, their families and caregivers, and other \\ngroups at risk in shaping the systems that exist to serve \\ntheir needs must go beyond nominal participation, \\nrecognising their unique perspective as experts by \\nexperience.138 \\nSetting \\npolicy \\nwithout \\nmeaningful \\nengagement of individuals with lived experience as key \\nstakeholders risks, at best, wasting resources on \\nineffective strategies and, at worst, causing harm.139,140 \\nPeople with lived experience have a key role in leading \\nsocial contact anti-stigma inter\\xad\\nventions,141,142 which is of \\nparticular relevance to efforts addressing intersecting \\nthe stigma related to COVID-19 and mental health. As \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic strains trust in authorities, \\nlocalism becomes more important than ever as an \\neffective approach to scaling up inter\\xad\\nventions.\\nThe potential of peer support and further collaboration \\nwith people with lived experience of mental illness needs \\nto be recognised within mental health-care systems, \\nbuilding on emerging initiatives (panel 1). Key lessons \\nare to invest in capacity building for service users and to \\nsupport peer workers to bring relational values to work \\n(ie, offering equal, reciprocal relationships and taking a \\nwhole-of-life approach rather than one focused on \\nillness). Currently, both LMICs and HICs have a long \\nway to go in ensuring involvement of service users in \\nresearch, policy, and programme implementation and \\nevaluation.145,146 For system change, there needs to be a \\nconscious effort, backed by investment and policy, to \\nequip and enable service users to be actively involved in \\nall aspects of the system of care.147\\nSectors: the what of global mental health\\nTo achieve good mental health as part of COVID-19 \\nresponse efforts, we must ensure that people’s basic needs \\nare met and that human rights are protected. When social \\ninequalities remain unaddressed, mental health inter\\xad\\nventions are less effective.148,149 The pandemic response, \\nincluding the mental health response, requires recognition \\nof the syndemic co-occurrence and inter\\xad\\naction of mental \\nhealth, physical health, and social context (panel 2). Many \\nof the social determinants of poor mental health, such as \\nliving in cramped conditions, scarce access to clean water \\nand green spaces, poor nutrition, informal employment, \\nand precarious working conditions, increase the risk of \\ncontracting SARS-CoV-2 and suffering complications after \\ninfection.156 Therefore, economic recovery packages \\nshould strategically address the social determinants that \\nincrease susceptibility to both COVID-19 and mental ill \\nhealth. Across diverse settings, growing evidence indicates \\nthat national-level policies to improve the living conditions \\nof low-paid workers and families can improve mental \\nhealth at the population level.157–159 Social welfare, active \\nlabour market programmes that help people to retain or \\nregain jobs, family support programmes, and debt support \\nare all likely to help reduce the mental health impact of \\nthe crisis.160 In Latin America and Africa, governmental \\ncash transfer programmes have doc\\xad\\numented positive \\nmental health benefits, which could be more impactful \\nthan ever during the economic contraction caused by \\nPanel 2: Applying syndemic theory to global mental health \\nin the context of COVID-19\\nSyndemic theory postulates that specific localised sociocultural, \\neconomic, and political conditions contribute to patterns of \\nmultimorbidity, and that settings without the same contextual \\nfeatures will not share these multimorbidity patterns.150–152 \\nSyndemic theory goes beyond comorbidity to recognise the \\nclustering of health burdens in a specific population that \\nbiologically interact to worsen health, and the shared \\nsociostructural forces that exacerbate the biological disease \\ninteraction.150,153 Therefore, diseases become concentrated in \\nspecific geographical or temporal contexts where people are \\nexposed to harmful social conditions, interacting at individual \\nand population levels to worsen health.\\nThe ways in which, in some settings, COVID-19 is comorbid \\nwith high prevalence of non-communicable diseases, \\nincluding cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, and mental \\nhealth conditions, and that these other conditions fall along \\ngradients of economic and other disparities, suggests that \\nthere are different types of syndemics around the world, \\nincluding in low-income and middle-income countries. There \\nis not one universal COVID-19 syndemic, but rather context-\\nspecific interactions substantially aggravated in specific social \\ngroups and geographies.152 We cannot refer to a global \\nCOVID-19 syndemic, as the stark differences in disease \\npattern and response between countries like New Zealand \\nand the USA clearly show. A nuanced and localised approach \\nis crucial.\\nApproaching different local syndemics that involve COVID-19 \\nhighlights the need for integrated, intersectoral, \\nand interdisciplinary responses. The interactions between \\nsubstance misuse, violence, and HIV or AIDS154 led to the \\ndevelopment of various multilevel interventions, including \\nintegrated behavioural interventions focusing on intimate \\npartner violence and HIV prevention; integrated trauma-\\nfocused care to reduce substance misuse and post-traumatic \\nstress disorder; synchronous community mobilisation \\ninterventions to reduce gender-based violence, \\nHIV, and sexually transmitted illnesses (among men and \\nwomen); and economic empowerment interventions to \\nreduce gender-based violence and HIV risk.155 For COVID-19, \\ntaking a syndemic approach should similarly influence mental \\nhealth responses and research, by recognising how biological \\nand sociostructural factors interact to create mental health \\ninequalities and by promoting a multilevel, intersectoral \\nresponse that addresses the sociopolitical dynamics that lead \\nto the clustering and interaction of poverty, infection, \\nand mental ill health.150\\n544\\t\\nwww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   June 2021\\nReview\\nCOVID-19.161 For example, greater coverage of the \\nconditional cash transfer programme, Bolsa Família, in \\nmunicipalities across Brazil was associated with reduced \\nsuicide rates.162 In Malawi’s Social Cash Transfer \\nProgramme, depressive symptoms in young people were \\nreduced by 15 percentage points, with the greatest benefits \\nfor those with the worst mental health.163,164 Examples of \\nother initiatives that have incorporated social and \\neconomic interventions into health programmes with \\nimportant lessons for the crisis include the Atmiyata \\nprogramme165 and the Society for Nutrition, Education, \\nand Health Action’s violence prevention interventions166 in \\nIndia, Dream-a-World cultural therapy in Jamaica,167 the \\nintegrated intervention model for dialogue and screening \\nin Kenya,168 and innovative nutrition programmes that \\nsimultaneously address violence, poverty, and mental \\ndistress in Ecuador.169\\nFurthermore, inequality is an important determinant \\nof mental health,170 and this is worsening as a result of \\nthe pandemic. Therefore, we must follow the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goal principle of leaving no one behind \\nand target interventions for the most marginalised \\ngroups. Such groups include people with severe mental \\nillness or disabilities, communities living in extreme \\npoverty, immigrants and displaced populations, and \\nindividuals who face discrimination for any reason.171,172 \\nThe challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic further justify \\nuse of the principle of proportionate universalism,160 \\nwhich focuses on protecting the rights and basic needs of \\nyoung people (eg, enabling schools to open safely); \\nreducing gender-based violence, which has escalated \\nduring the pandemic; and implementing environmental \\nprotection strategies, given the impact of environmental \\ndegradation on virus transmission and mental health.173\\nPanel 3: Recommendations to build back better\\nIntegrating mental health services into UHC\\nCollaborative care strategies for building community capacity, \\nbased in primary care setup for community care and linkages \\nwith specialist services, is and must be the singular focus for \\ninvestment.178 Collaborative care designs are essential in UHC \\nand must be contextually appropriate and, through intersectoral \\npartnerships, simultaneously address social and human rights \\nconcerns. It is essential to avoid impoverishment and \\ncatastrophic health-care costs in accessing mental health care.\\nImproving access and coverage of psychosocial interventions\\nA crucial aspect of UHC for mental health care is the community \\ndelivery of psychosocial interventions by front-line providers, \\nsuch as community health workers and peers (ie, task-sharing \\ninterventions). These providers are needed for addressing mental \\nhealth issues related to COVID-19 and for deploying a host of \\ninnovations, such as digital training and competency \\nassessment, peer supervision, and quantifiable quality metrics, \\nto help build a workforce to address prevention and treatment \\ngaps.179–182\\nEliminating coercion in mental health care\\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has \\nlaid down the foundational values of a world in which coercion \\nmust be abolished in all aspects of health care and for all \\npeople, and has developed various strategies to support \\ndecision making, rather than substitute it.183 A crucial element is \\nengagement of people with lived experience. Peer support \\nactivities are associated with improved treatment outcomes \\nand promotion of human rights.184,185 These strategies are \\nessential during the COVID-19 pandemic for the inclusion of \\nindividuals with mental health conditions in the design and \\nimplementation of services.186,187\\nIntegrating mental health interventions into other sectors\\nCOVID-19 has amply shown the interdependence of health and \\nother sectors.188 The relationships between mental health and \\ngender, education, employment, and social networks is \\nattracting fresh policy attention in the face of unprecedented \\nworsening of poverty and inequality in the near future. \\nIntersectoral strategies are essential for sustainable recovery \\nfrom mental disorders, and for addressing stigma and other \\nnegative consequences associated with health seeking119 for \\noverall reduction in the incidence of new cases.\\nAddressing the mental health of children and young people\\nOne blind spot of global mental health has been its relative \\nneglect of children and young people (aged <24 years). \\nMore than 80% of the world’s young people live in low-income \\nand middle-income countries. Given how the complete closure \\nof schools and colleges is directly affecting the lives of \\nyoung people, building back better with intersectional \\napproaches must explicitly address this crucially important \\ndemographic group to promote nurturing environments at \\nhome, in schools, and across neighbourhoods.189\\nIncorporating technological innovations in mental health \\nservices\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has fuelled a striking transformation \\nin the use of digital platforms for various mental health-care \\ntasks. The opportunities presented by use of digital technology \\ncould address stigma and discrimination, isolation and \\nmarginalisation; identify individuals at risk (through social \\nmedia footprints); and assist with the training and supervision \\nof front-line workers. However, caution is needed so that its use \\ndoes not increase the existing disparities in access. Use of \\npersonal digital information also needs to be done in \\naccordance with local regulations and in a way that maximises \\nprotection of privacy and confidentiality.190\\nUHC=universal health coverage.\\nFor more on the Society for \\nNutrition, Education, and \\nHealth see https://\\nsnehamumbai.org\\nwww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   June 2021\\t\\n545\\nReview\\nBuilding back better\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health in \\nall contexts and has highlighted the weaknesses of \\nmental health systems globally. COVID-19 has shown the \\nmental health impacts of pandemics not only on \\nindividuals with existing mental health needs but also \\nacross populations due to the polices aimed to stem its \\nspread, which disproportionately affect vulnerable and \\nalready disadvantaged groups. It is vital that we recognise \\nthese effects as a historic opportunity to reimagine \\nmental health systems, building on the vast body of \\nclinical, implementation, and public health science119,174 \\nwith the active engagement of all relevant stakeholders, \\nparticularly people with lived experience.\\nBuilding back better was a concept introduced in a \\nreport issued at the second anniversary of the \\n2004 Indian Ocean tsunami by the UN Secretary-\\nGeneral’s Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, former \\nUS president, Bill Clinton.175 Since then, the concept \\nhas become the approach for nearly all post-disaster \\nreconstruction \\nprogrammes, \\nincluding \\nupending \\npreviously unchal\\xad\\nlenged and inadequate policies and \\npractices. In 2013, the principles of building back better \\nwere used by WHO to provide a framework to support \\nthe development of sustainable post-disaster mental \\nhealth systems, globally.176 Resource-limited countries, \\nsuch as Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, Nepal, and the \\noccupied Palestinian territories, have shown how \\nfragile mental health systems can be strengthened \\nduring and in the wake of public health emergencies.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the likelihood of future \\npandemics highlight the importance of resilient and \\nresponsive mental health systems.177 Although increased \\nglobal and national investments in mental health were in \\ngreat need even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there is \\na threat that the diversion of policy focus on the pandemic \\nmight further delay progress in mental health. We must \\nwork in concert with all stakeholders to ensure that \\nresources are mobilised for strengthening mental health \\nsystems and that these investments are used in an \\neffective and efficient manner, and cover the entire \\nspectrum of needs, from promotion, protection, and \\nprevention to treatment, care, and recovery. Reports from \\nThe Lancet Commission on global mental health and \\nsustainable development119 and World Bank’s Disease \\nControl Priorities174 have outlined priorities for the \\nstrengthening of mental health systems. Within the \\ncontext of COVID-19, we recommend a set of practical \\nactions to address these priorities (panel 3).\\nConclusions\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted every aspect of \\nlife in all countries almost simultaneously and, in this \\nrespect, represents a global phenomenon unlike any \\nother in human history. Emerging evidence indicates \\nthat the mental health impacts will be large, long-\\nlasting, and greatest in under-resourced contexts and \\ndisadvantaged populations. Unless addressed robustly \\nand urgently, these impacts will contribute to enormous \\nhuman suffering, premature mortality, and social \\nbreakdown, and will slow down economic recovery. \\nAlthough there was already an enormous crisis relating \\nto mental health before the pandemic, COVID-19 \\npresents an historic opportunity for all countries and \\nglobal agencies to reassess how human society organises \\nitself to recover from these impacts. We know what this \\nshould look like; not only should we invest in building \\nmental health systems now but we should also ensure \\nthat these investments embrace the diversity of \\nexperiences and actions that characterise mental ill \\nhealth, well beyond the narrow biomedical focus on \\ndoctors, diagnoses, and drugs that has dominated \\nmental health policies globally. Thus, we call for a \\nbalanced approach that addresses the social determinants \\nof mental health and the individual clinical needs for \\npeople with mental health disorders. Mental health \\ninterventions that fail to take account of social \\ndeterminants of mental ill health, especially those \\nexacerbated by COVID-19, will fail to achieve their \\nintended impacts. With a balanced app\\xad\\nroach, we can not \\nonly reimagine mental health care in LMICs, but also \\nreframe mental health as a common and prioritised \\naspiration in all countries worldwide.\\nSearch strategy and selection criteria\\nSection leads searched the peer-reviewed literature on \\nPubMed for articles published between Jan 1 and \\nJuly 31, 2020, describing the impact of the COVID-19 \\npandemic on mental health using the search terms “mental \\nhealth”, “depression”, “anxiety”, “psychosis”, \\n“schizophrenia”, “posttraumatic stress disorder”, “suicide”, \\n“substance use disorders”, “alcohol use disorders”, or “child \\nand adolescent mental health” and “COVID-19”.  The search \\nwas restricted to articles published in English. We used the \\ncurrent fiscal-year classifications of World Bank Country and \\nLending Groups and included low-income, lower-middle-\\nincome, and upper-middle-income countries on the basis of \\n2019 economic data. Given that research on this topic \\ncontinues to evolve rapidly and, to date, there have been \\nrelatively few studies published from low-income and \\nmiddle-income countries, we broadened our search to \\nGoogle searches and contacted key informants (including \\nthe large and globally representative group of authors of \\nthis Review). We reviewed reports and guidance from WHO, \\nthe Inter-Agency Standing Committee, MHPSS.net and \\nmhinnovation.net, and reached out to non-governmental \\norganisations in low-income and middle-income countries. \\nThe resulting literature was summarised and interrogated \\nby our authorship group, which included senior global \\nmental health experts, and relevant content was \\nsynthesised through multiple rounds of feedback and \\nreview. \\n546\\t\\nwww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   June 2021\\nReview\\nContributors\\nLK and VP conceptualised and drafted the full manuscript.
