    "abstract": "We, the children of the Anthropocene Era, are entering the 4 th industrial revolution and the impact is going to be pervasive and of greater magnitude compared to the previous industrial revolutions. The incoming changes, approaching at an accelerating speed, will be impacting everything and everybody and blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres; they will affect the bio-psycho-social dimensions, our narratives and even what it means to be human. If we are not farsighted and do not plan effectively, the results could be very problematic for all life forms on Earth. If we manage the 4 th industrial revolution with the same blindness and forms of denial with which we managed the previous industrial revolutions, the negative effects will be exponential. But we are not impotent; we can manage this revolution wisely, increase the positive effects and mitigate the negative ones since technology is designed, made and managed by us. We cannot afford to be na\u00efve and just hope that technology will automatically improve our lives; new and effective tools for understanding and governing such epochal changes are needed apart from the need for facilitating awareness in all stakeholders about the dangers and opportunities offered by the incoming changes. Effective forms of education are crucial. The fourth revolution could be an unprecedented success if we are able to manage complex processes and at the same time assure that each innovation will not only bring change but also foster a more humane, sustainable, peaceful and prosperous future for all. For effective governance, we need effective tools. One much-needed tool is the clear understanding of the crucial role played by the processes by which we humans construe experiences of ourselves, of others and other life forms. In other words, most of us still think we live in a unidimensional reality, but we live in a socially construed consensus reality, ignoring which may create crucial blind spots, diminish our coping capacities and resilience, thereby generating humongous self-inflicted damages. To meet these challenges, effective and scientifically validated person- and people- centered educational approaches are necessary. They will play a crucial role in enabling us to stop wasting our best resources\u2014human and natural capital\u2014and will facilitate us to achieve effective and sustainable governance.

    "body": "2 There is a large amount of scientific evidence that our present relationship with ourselves, others and the planet we live in is the main variable influencing all life forms and the planet itself, a dramatic epochal change referred to by scientists as the Anthropocene (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000). The human population\u2019s exponential increase favored by the first, second and third industrial revolutions in numbers, production and consumption behaviors has produced such dramatic and exorbitant costs to ourselves and all life forms. The United Nations estimates that at the present pace, the number of people on the planet is set to rise to 9.7 billion in 2050 with 2 billion aged over 60 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2015). According to the recent The Living Planet Report , the problems are getting worse as populations and consumption keep growing faster than technology\u2019s ability to find new ways of expanding what can be produced from the natural world. This led the report to predict that by 2030, if nothing changes, mankind would need two planets to sustain its present lifestyle. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2012) reminds us that the destruction and pollution of the environment have dire consequences on people\u2019s health: globally, 23% of all deaths and 22% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are estimated to be attributed to the environment. In total, the number of deaths linked to the environment amounts to 12.6 million per year (based on 2012 data). This burden could be lessened significantly by reducing risks (WHO 2016a). Unfortunately, the risks and their impact are rising, the latest WHO report in 2016 dramatically shows that 92% of the world\u2019s population lives in places where air quality levels exceed WHO safety limits, which means that 9 out of 10 people live in countries with excessive air pollution. Every year, 3 million deaths are associated with exposure to outdoor air pollution. Over 4 million people die prematurely from illness due to household air pollution (WHO 2016c; WHO 2016d). There are also other kinds of mounting problems around the world and in particular in the most prosperous countries. Paradoxically, on the one hand the world has had since the Second World War an exponential increase in the availability of material goods, services and connectivity, and on the other hand, an equally significant increase in the number of people that feel disconnected, depressed or burdened by narcissism, consumerism, self-exploitation and lack of meaning (Han, 2014). There is scientific evidence that depression predisposes people to myocardial infarction (heart attack) and diabetes, both of which conversely increase the likelihood of depression. Many risk factors such as low socioeconomic status, alcohol abuse and stress are common to both mental disorders and other non-communicable diseases. There is also substantial concurrence of mental disorders and substance use disorders. Taken together, mental, neurological and substance use disorders exact a high toll; they accounted for 13% of the total global burden of disease in the year 2004. Depression alone accounts for 4.3% of the global 3 burden of disease and is the single largest cause of disability worldwide, 11% of all years lived with disability globally, particularly considering women. The economic consequences of these health losses are equally large (WHO, 2013). The WHO reminds us that every year more than 800,000 people end their own lives and there are many more people who attempt suicide. Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities and entire countries. Globally, it was the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds in 2012. The number of suicides increases during moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems. In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse, loss and a sense of isolation is strongly associated with suicidal behavior. Suicide rates are also high amongst vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees, migrants, indigenous peoples, LGBTI persons and prisoners (WHO 2016b). To make things worse, the effects of climate change, such as the acidification of the oceans, the desertification of large parts of the planet, the increasing deforestation and destruction of biodiversity, interact with other explosive realities. There are still an enormous number of people suffering from hunger, ill health, wars, terrorism, violence, unequal access to resources and opportunities, racism and many forms of discrimination and injustice. Many people are forced to leave their homes and countries due to warfare and ethnic or religious fanaticism that enlarge the growing numbers of refugees and migrants, which in turn creates an escalating spiral whereby they become the innocent targets of fear and bigotry in nations where they seek refuge. A mounting number of scientists warn us that we are fast reaching the tipping point, where mitigation and/or reversal of trends will not be within our reach if we do not act promptly and effectively (IPCC, 2007, 2013, 2014). The fourth industrial revolution could help us exit from this human-produced quagmire, only if we are capable of effective planning and governance. For sure the fourth industrial revolution will create new problems. It is estimated that massive unemployment of unskilled workers and the disappearance of some jobs becoming automated by computerized machines will be one of the effects of the changes looming ahead that we will need to deal with: The International Labour Organization (ILO) has estimated that in the next 10-20 years, the number of jobs threatened by new technologies will be around 47% of the total jobs in the United States and between 40% and 60% in Europe (Degryse, 2016). Rising inequalities is another big problem. According to Credit Suisse\u2019s Global Wealth Report 2015 , the richest 1% of the population now owns half of all household wealth. Oxfam\u2019s new report states that 62 individuals control more assets than the poorer half of the world\u2019s population. Researchers such as Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found that unequal societies tend to be more violent, have higher numbers of people in prison, experience greater levels of mental illness, have lower life expectancies and lower levels of trust. These inequalities will create even more fears and backlash against change. The rise Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 4 in interconnectedness will bring rising dangers on security, cyber terrorism and likely create a 1984-like scenario; there is also the risk that the cyber revolution may deprive us of our privacy right, creating some planetary Big Brother effect (Maynard, 2015). All these smart machines and smart customized services can become self-inflicted forms of destruction of human capital if we do not plan the Internet of Things wisely or design smart machines to be not only smart, but also wise and people-centered. Of course we all enjoy the new opportunities of being connected, having access to connect to people and services\u2014undreamed of until a few years ago\u2014that the technological multinationals are offering us for free. At the same time these new opportunities go hand in hand with profound changes that may also bring about some boomerang effects: Various nations have lost technological sovereignty without which their economic and cultural sovereignty have been greatly reduced. The artificial intelligence power that some multinationals are acquiring simply by sucking up the data of millions of people that are using their free services does not have equals, but this kind of innovation, for some new media sociologist like Evgeny Morozov, brings a risk of democracy being replaced by a futuristic scenario of technological Big Data feudalism (Morozov 2013). It is obvious that in all these scenarios, prevention is far more feasible and less costly than to wait and see and eventually being forced to do emergency repair jobs when it is too late. people-centered and sustainable way; they all have a common denominator: to ensure that the planned changes are person-, people- and community-centered and sustainable. It is imperative to identify the barriers, to achieve these goals and work effectively to identify, remove or reduce the barriers (Norgaard, 2011); (Zucconi, 2013, 2016). \u201cYou know, the principle of empathy gives broader meaning, by the way, to Dr. King\u2019s philosophy of nonviolence... It seems like we got an empathy shortage, an empathy deficit. More serious than the federal budget deficit. We\u2019ve become so cynical that it almost seems naive to believe that we can understand each other across the gulf of race, or class or region or religion...\u201d Barack Obama, Martin Luther King Day, Chicago IL, Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, January 21, 2002 \u201cOur relationship with ourselves, others and the world is an important determinant of our mental, physical, and social health.\u201d 5 I strongly believe that some of the variables that will effectively foster a more humane and sustainable future are: \u2022\t More awareness \u2022\t More empathy \u2022\t More capacity for respecting oneself, others and the world \u2022\t More responsibility (in the sense of the ability to respond) Since reality is socially construed, in order to have a fourth industrial revolution that will protect and promote human and natural capital, we need to educate and empower everybody to make their contribution to achieve this goal. mental, physical, and social health. When people and societies are alienated from parts of themselves, they relate to others and the planet in alienated and distorted ways. For example, at present, profit is calculated in a mechanistic reductionist way, the so called \u201cbottom line\u201d; at the national level we still use the Gross National Product, whose standards completely ignore the destruction of human and natural capital. With a more realistic and sustainable approach there are at least 3 variables that account for the so-called Triple Bottom Line (TBL) which measures economic, ecological and social results. The Quadruple Bottom Line (QBL) also takes into consideration cultural aspects like governance (Zucconi, 2013). Recently, an Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI) has been formulated. It has a broader way of measuring natural capital, such as forests; produced capital, such as roads and factories; and human capital, which includes levels of education, knowledge, and creativity. Preliminary findings indicate that it is possible to trace changes in the components of wealth by country and link these to economic growth, and the impact of declines or increases in natural capital as an economic productive base (UNU-IHDP, 2012). Effective economic growth can be attained only through ecologically conscious green or blue economy (Pauli, 2010). We need to apply effective metrics and create new ones. We need to use in future planning and project management some effective human capital and environmental impact assessment scales, or use tools already available like the Health Impact Assessment (HIA) to measure and predict health consequences (WHO 2016a). If such assessments are performed at the \u201cPerson-centered Approach focuses on health and not on illness, on capacities rather than on limitations; empowers and promotes learning, well-being and resilience by facilitating the development of the potentialities of individuals, groups and organizations.\u201d Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 6 planning stage, we can have projects with a focus on sustainability, people-centeredness, quality, vulnerability and resilience factors. tools are already in existence and they have ample scientific validation for their efficacy and efficiency. Here is a partial list of some of them: \u2022 The Person-Centered Approach is a scientifically proven effective way to create solutions on a win-win basis. The Person-Centered Approach (PCA) is a systemic, holistic approach applied successfully in interpersonal relationships including conflict resolution. PCA focuses on health and not on illness, on capacities rather than on limitations; empowers and promotes learning, well-being and resilience by facilitating the development of the potentialities of individuals, groups and organizations. PCA helps people to grow, learn self-regulation and take responsibility for what they do rather than fostering dependency. \u2022 The Person-Centered Planning (PCP) is another scientifically sound and process- oriented approach designed to empower people. It focuses on the people and their needs by putting them in charge of defining the direction of their lives. PCP is being applied successfully in many settings and in particular in the design and management of health and special needs facilities. \u2022 The People-Centered Approach (PeCA) is a scientifically validated, interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach designed to be employed in large scale projects focused on fostering the maximum level of effectiveness in protecting and promoting human ecologies and natural ecosystems and promoting sustainable change. The People- Centered Approach (PeCA) is a values-oriented approach based on equal rights, deep respect for all forms of life, cultures and traditions. Lately, even the International Labour Organization is recommending the use of People-Centered Approaches (Kiniger- Passigli and Biondi, 2015). The PeCA promotes empathic understanding, mutual respect and effective communication and collaboration among different stakeholders through actions of empowerment and resilience. obstacles remain in the way of effective and sustainable governance at the local, national and international levels. The lack of awareness of the magnitude of the problems and the changes needed in the behaviors of all the stakeholders to manage the serious mounting challenges facing humanity is in part due to barriers of a sociological and psychological nature that impede effective coordinated actions of various stakeholders. The underlying mechanism at work in the promotion or resistance to change or the denial of threats like climate warming varies from culture to culture: how reality is socially construed and how individuals and organizations construe their experiences and narratives are relevant for the understanding of 7 the promotion of change needed to promote sustainable governance and to deal effectively with the barriers to change (Zucconi, 2013, 2016). \u2013 Walter Truett Anderson (1990) In the age of globalization and of growing complexity, in order to meet the challenges of our present and future, we need new and effective ways to facilitate the capacity of awareness and integration in our ways of knowing and behaving. We need to foster a new socio- psychological literacy for billions of people; a socio-psychological compass and a holistic/ systemic way of being in relationship with ourselves, others and the planet, to enable us to navigate the rippling currents of change. Nowadays, decision makers and experts seem not to take notice in their blueprints of the governance of how individuals, communities, societies and cultures are fully immersed in the ways they call reality and perceive it, which in effect is not quite what they intend\u2014reality as an objective fact. What they call reality is the way individuals construe their experiences of the so called reality at the personal and societal levels. The ways individuals and communities construe their experiences can be very useful in helping them cope effectively with their circumstances, but only if they foster a clear understanding of how problems are generated and how they can be effectively resolved or mitigated. As the history of humankind amply shows, the construction of experience mistakenly taken for objective reality can, even with the best intentions, create destructive boomerang effects, immense sufferings and has even resulted in the downfall of some empires and civilizations in the past. The way we still use some dysfunctional metrics to measure growth is one of the many examples of how we make ourselves blind to the obvious: We can still read in the daily news that the economy is growing even when society is bent on effectively destroying its human and natural capital, impacting present and future generations negatively and behaving like cancerous cells multiplying in a living organism. Drawing national borders with a ruler might look neat in a geo-political map of post- colonial nations but that blindness to reality will provoke chaos and immense suffering for generations and spread to larger areas, as the present social pandemic of violence seems to indicate. Only blindness can explain the recent behaviors that some of the most advanced nations have adopted in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and the Middle East. Only blindness can explain the lack of preparation for the consequences from the dislocation of immense numbers of people running away for life from their war torn countries, risking their lives to have a chance in more safe and prosperous countries, but who in turn experience a rise in fear of insecurity, which generates the rise of populist politics, racism and violence. Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 8 \u201cThe world of everyday life is not only taken for granted as reality by the ordinary members of society in the subjectively meaningful conduct of their lives. It is a world that originates in their thoughts and actions, and is maintained as real by these.\u201d \u2013 Berger & Luckmann, 1966, page 19 What is perceived as real varies from society to society and is produced, transmitted and conserved through social processes. Our perception of reality is largely modeled from beliefs and assumptions that are typical of the society and culture to which we belong. What we know, what we consider true and right, the behaviors we adopt, all are influenced by the social/ cultural environment in which we live. This process happens through the internalization of \u201creality\u201d that occurs during the socialization process. We need new and effective ways of coping with our rapidly changing realities. A way to become aware of how we construe our experiences of what we call reality, the relationship with ourselves, the others, the world. We need to foster at every level of society an awareness of the social construction of reality, of our powers and responsibilities for the present and the future of humankind and the whole planet (Anderson, 1990, 1997, 2016). Socio-cultural and personal constructs are the ways in which communities and individuals construe their experiences at the emotional and cognitive levels. The social and personal constructs are interacting with and influencing the social and individual dimensions all the time. Some of the variables influencing us are: \u2022\t Our relationships with significant others\u2014parents, siblings etc., by the roles that they give us and by the ways of being (constructs) we introject which become part of our personality, influencing how we relate with ourselves, others and the world. \u2022\t The social environment through the imposition of societal norms. \u2022\t The narratives we absorb from kids\u2019 fables, cartoons, movies, TV, social media, popular heroes. \u2022\t The formal and informal education we receive. For all the above reasons, we need to educate everybody to understand the social and individual processes that lie at the base of the construction of narratives that we call reality. What we call reality is a consensus reality and is largely shaped by our beliefs. If our socially construed and personally construed beliefs are made conscious and their values made explicit, \u201cWe need to foster at every level of society an awareness of the social construction of reality, of our powers and responsibilities for the present and the future of humankind and the whole planet.\u201d 9 we can examine them and verify if some of our beliefs are obsolete or dysfunctional, so we can update and replace dysfunctional ways of thinking and feeling with more functional ones, a process that is characteristic of fully functioning persons (Rogers, 1965); (Zucconi, 2013). is only during the educational process that much of the social construction of reality occurs. Education is the process by which the minds of the new generation are shaped about what is real (Dewey, 1897, 1924); (Rogers, 1969, 1983); (Freire, 1970); (Foucault, 1980); (Zimring, 1994); (Morin, 2001, 2007a, 2007b); (Rogers, Lyon & Tausch, 2014); (Zucconi, 2013, 2016). Francis Bacon stated that knowledge is power. Most people will agree with that, but for many, it is still not automatically self-evident that to have faulty knowledge is to lose power and is a lethally effective form of socially self-inflicted harm. Present traditional education often stifles our natural learning abilities unintentionally. All lifeforms\u2019 survival depends on effective and rapid learning as to how to adapt their behaviors to environmental changes. We need to retool and upgrade all levels of our education. Formal and informal education at any level needs to offer us the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will enable us to survive and even prosper in the present period of change by learning the needed skills for coping and governing in peaceful and sustainable ways through the turbulent scenarios of the Anthropocene Era. \u201cEducation and health go hand in hand. The evidence demonstrating the links is overwhelming.\u201d \u2013 Margaret Chan Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), MDG Summit: Remarks at Roundtable 2:  Meeting the Goals for Health & Education, New York, September 20, 2010 Education is the wellspring of our wellbeing, prosperity and resilience; it is through education that we human beings can transcend some of the physical limits of biological evolution. There is ample scientific evidence of the connection between health and education, education and prosperity (KPMG Foundation, 2006); (Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2006); (Every Child a Chance Trust 2009); (OECD, 2010); (WHO, 2013, 2016a, 2016b). mortality by 1.8 percentage points; it also reduces the risk of heart disease by 2.16 percentage points, and the risk of diabetes by 1.3 percentage points. The significant association between education and health has been observed in many countries and time periods, and in a wide variety of health measures. The differences between educational inequalities are significant: in the U.S. in 1999, the age-adjusted mortality rate of high school dropouts aged 25 to 64 was more than twice as large as the mortality rate of those with some college education (Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2006). Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 10 Not only is education an important social determinant of health, but higher levels of education help to create healthier, more cohesive, prosperous and resilient communities and nations. The benefits of education include better levels of social engagement, an important variable of cohesive, safer and healthier societies. At the individual level, the knowledge, personal and social skills provided through education better equip individuals to access and use information and services to maintain and improve their own health and their family\u2019s (Feinstein et al. 2003). To be more effective, education needs to be people-centered and empower people to be in contact with themselves, others and the world, instead of stifling the natural human capital as often is the case with traditional education.  Effective education needs to protect and promote the enhancement and actualization of values like empathy, respect, deep contact, creativity and resilience (Rogers, 1969, 1983); (Gershon & Vincow, 1997); (Lambert & McCombs; 1997); (Catalano & Catalano 1999); (Thorkildsen, 2011); (Zucconi, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016); (Costa, 2014). If I am able to relate to myself with respect and empathy, then it is much easier and natural for me to relate to other human beings with respect and empathy, even those with different beliefs and customs. This is not mere wishful thinking, there is ample scientific evidence that shows that people who are able to relate to themselves with respect and empathy are not only able to relate to other human beings with respect and empathy, but they are better capable of being in touch, of perceiving life around them and attuning themselves empathically with all other life forms. This way of being is not exceptional, it is typical of mentally healthy human beings (Rogers, 1951, 1961, 1969, 1977, 1983); (Zucconi, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016); (Silani, Zucconi & Lamm, 2013). Unfortunately centuries of spreading alienation have made lack of contact and chronic reification \u201cnormal\u201d. Those alienated individuals that relate to themselves, others and the world, like something that can be turned into a commodity and sold for monetary gain, are considered smart and successful by many other equally alienated human beings. The results are irresponsible environmental exploitation, social injustice and the destruction of our planet. It is encouraging to see what Pope Francis has pronounced in his encyclical \u2018 Laudato Si\u2019 , an effective call for an \u2018ecological conversion\u2019 of every good Christian, a person who in his/her feelings and behaviors respects every human being and living creature irrespective of differences. If spiritual and political leaders and opinion makers offer a congruent narrative of the vital importance of establishing relationships based on respect and empathy with all life forms, this message would be an excellent teaching and such motivational narratives, if introjected, will have significant positive results. \u201cEffective education needs to protect and promote the enhancement and actualization of the natural qualities of empathy, respect, deep contact, creativity and resilience.\u201d 11 Education at its best is a bio-psycho-social-spiritual learning experience that promotes our capacities to live a significant existence and develop our potentialities to become creative, resilient and productive citizens. How we reorganize education is very important for our present and future, since learning is for our species an empowering and adaptive way to accelerate change. Human educational activities and organizations may represent the most important way for humans to ensure our own survival and to save our planet. The World Academy of Art & Science (WAAS) has launched a project with its sister institution, the World University Consortium (WUC), to create a space open to all the stakeholders to brainstorm and retool education to serve people\u2019s urgent needs and to better cope with present emergencies. * An effective people-centered education is needed to create more aware and resilient citizens who will integrate knowledge, promote collective wisdom, build a sustainable society in which duties and responsibilities are equally important as rights and equal opportunities. of the social construction of reality; it is more and more evident that we need a paradigm change in traditional education in order to enable people to deal effectively with the mounting challenges facing humanity. This retooling needs to start with our frames of reference. We need to create a new paradigm in education in order to enable education to serve people\u2019s needs and to have relevance in public service, social responsibility, sustainable governance and development. Education is one of the main narratives to prepare new generations to be an active and constructive part of society and is one of the main carriers of values. Values can be implicit or explicit. Theorists like John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky, whose collective work focused on how students learn, have laid the groundwork for student-centered learning. Carl Rogers\u2019 ideas and research on the functioning of human beings have contributed significantly to person-centered education, promoting student-centered and lifelong learning throughout * See http://wunicon.org \u201cWe need to create a new paradigm in education in order to enable education to serve people\u2019s needs and to have relevance in public service, social responsibility and sustainable governance and development.\u201d Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 12 one\u2019s lifespan, underlining the importance of teachers to become more effective by helping them become facilitators of learning. In order to be effective facilitators of learning, teachers need to learn and be capable of creating with the learners a facilitative empowering environment based on trust, empathy and respect. Of course an exhaustive illustration of this topic would require my mentioning many more authors, a task impossible to accomplish in this paper. I just want to add that the world famous pedagogist Maria Montessori was a forerunner of student-centered learning, facilitating preschool children to learn through independent self-directed activities. Malcolm Knowles is also one of the major figures in student-centered adult education who has applied Rogers\u2019 ideas (1975, 1984a, 1984b, 1990). \u201cTraditional education ignores or suppresses learner responsibility.\u201d \u2013 Armstrong (2012) Self-determination theory focuses on how an individual\u2019s behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When students are given the opportunity to evaluate their learning, learning becomes an incentive. In the traditional teacher-centered teaching, teachers have been the primary source of knowledge. In a student-centered classroom, self-regulation, empowerment and active learning are facilitated. some criterion held by the teacher, is directly contrary to the implications of therapy for significant learning.\u201d  \u2013 Carl Rogers \u201cI never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.\u201d  \u2013 Albert Einstein One of the most crucial differences between student-centered learning and teacher- centered learning is the assessment. In student-centered learning, students actively participate in the evaluation of their learning. Having an assessment process that involves the entire learning community in a sort of action research to measure the learning outcomes is an important aspect of student-centered education and a significant way to support learning and motivation and an essential variable for assuring the success of the application of student- centered approaches. \u201cTalk to me \u2026 and I will forget Show me \u2026 and I will remember Involve me \u2026 and I will understand Step back \u2026 and I will act.\u201d \u2013  Confucius 13 Student-centered education fosters transferable skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and reflective thinking. The revised European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance states: \u201c Institutions should ensure that programmes are delivered in a way that encourages students to take an active role in creating the learning process and that the assessment of students reflects this approach .\u201d In Europe, student-centred learning has increased in prominence over the past few decades. The Leuven/Louvain-la-Neuve Ministerial Communiqu\u00e9 (Bologna Process 2009) underlines the relevance of student-centered education for effectively coping with the present societal changes (Geven & Attard, 2012). \u201c European higher education also faces the major challenge and the ensuing opportunities of globalization and accelerated technological developments with new providers, new learners and new types of learning. Student-centred learning and mobility will help students develop the competencies they need in a changing labour market and will empower them to become active and responsible citizens \u201d (Bologna Process 2009, p. 1). at every level and grade but there are some barriers that have slowed down the application of this approach; the major obstacles are the so called power issues. Student-centered learning is a process that requires power sharing and responsibilities sharing at the policy level, administrative level, curriculum development level, assessment and evaluation level, classroom management and relational level. Another important issue determining success or failure is the obvious fact that change has to be facilitated effectively by competent professionals in a systemic way. In the past there have been easily predictable and preventable failures, since one cannot just wish to change a school or an university by calling it student- centered; the staff and the teachers need to be retrained and motivated and in the retooling of the educational institution, the students/learners and all the stakeholders need to be actively involved in the process. Teacher-Centered Learning Person-/Student-Centered Learning Teacher has the power Student has less choice Students have a passive role Empowerment of students Student has more choice Students have an active role In order to be effective, projects aimed to facilitate change in an educational institution have to involve actively all the stakeholders, carry out a force field analysis, a feasibility study and promote change on a win-win for all base. Never forget that it is not only students that become better learners if they are understood, respected and empowered, but administrators and teachers are human too; they will be better administrators and teachers if their needs, ambivalence and fears are understood, respected and taken seriously into consideration. In other words, a student-centered learning project, in order to succeed, needs to be person- Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 14 centered, involve the whole educational community, thereby becoming a sustainable people-centered project (Zucconi, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016). In Person-Centered Education (PCE), also called student-centered education, values are made explicit to facilitate students to have a critical and proactive role, an effective training to make them become fully functioning members of the Polis. The Person-Centered Approach (PCA) was originated by the late Dr. Carl Rogers. PCA is a scientifically validated systemic, holistic approach with applications in all the helping professions: Psychology, Education, Medicine, Social Work, Management, Intercultural communication, conflict prevention, etc. The central hypothesis of the Person-Centered Approach is that individuals have within themselves vast resources for self-understanding and for changing their self-concepts, basic attitudes and self-directed behavior, and these resources can be tapped if a climate of facilitative psychological conditions is provided. PCA focuses on health, not illness; on learning, not on teaching; on solutions, not on problems. PCA empowers, rather than cures; promotes the development of potentialities of individuals, groups and organizations through safe and growth-promoting interpersonal relationships characterized by respect, trust, empathic understanding and authenticity. It focuses on supporting people\u2019s creativity and resilience, and makes them feel responsible for what they do rather than encouraging dependency (Barrett-Lennard,1998); (Zucconi, 2008, 2011, 2013); (Rogers, Lyon & Tausch, 2014). \u201cSo while I still hate to readjust my thinking, still hate to give up old ways of perceiving and conceptualizing, yet at some deeper level I have, to a considerable degree, come to realize that these painful reorganizations are what is known as learning.\u201d \u2013 Carl Rogers, On Becoming a Person, 1961 \u201cThe only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change.\u201d  \u2013 Carl Rogers Carl Rogers has identified some core conditions present in teachers that are effective facilitators of learning and relational capabilities. \u201cThe central hypothesis of the Person-Centered Approach is that individuals have within themselves vast resources for self-understanding and for changing their self-concepts, basic attitudes and self-directed behavior, and these resources can be tapped if a climate of facilitative psychological conditions is provided.\u201d 15 \u201cOver the years, however, the research evidence keeps piling up, and it points strongly to the conclusion that a high degree of empathy in a relationship is possibly the most potent and certainly one of the most potent factors in bringing about change and learning.\u201d   \u2013 Carl Rogers For Rogers there are 3 core conditions or capacities or relational attitudes that facilitate the process of student-centered learning, and they all converge on the capacity to be centered on the student in a facilitative way: Being genuine, real or congruent; being nonjudgmental and able to deeply trust and respect the student and believing in their potentialities; and being capable of understanding them with empathy, which create a facilitating climate in the classroom and promote effective learning. Realness and capacity of contact in the facilitator of learning . When the facilitator/ teacher relates to the students as real persons, and maintains a close relationship with the learners without presenting a front or a facade, she/he is much more likely to be effective. This means that the facilitator of learning is congruent, meaning that she/he is in contact with his/her own inner experience, without distorting or negating it in a defensive way: The feelings that she/he is experiencing are available to her/him and she/he is able to live these feelings, be them, and able to communicate them if appropriate in the learning context. It means real capacity for contact and encounter with oneself and the learner on a person-to- person basis. It means that the facilitator of learning has the capacity and the courage to be honest, real and transparent, it also means that the facilitator of learning has a good capacity of contact with himself/herself, others and the world, which indicates a good level of mental health. A nonjudgmental attitude , acceptance, trust, deep respect for the learner are other core attitudes needed in effective facilitators of learning. It is an attitude of sincere interest and appreciation for the learner, her or his opinions and feelings, a non-possessive caring for the learner, with real acceptance of the other. It is a basic trust, a belief that human nature and the learner are fundamentally trustworthy: so this is for the teacher not just a theory but also her/ his existential stance about human beings. Empathic understanding is the third core competency; the capacity of the teacher to understand the student\u2019s inner experiences, feelings, thoughts and behaviors deeply and to communicate to the learner such empathic understanding in a clear, simple, direct and delicate way. \u201c\u2026. [Students feel deeply appreciative] when they are simply understood\u2014not evaluated, not judged, simply understood from their own point of view, not the teacher\u2019s.\u201d  \u2013 Rogers 1967 304-311 The strength of Rogers\u2019 approach lies in part in his focus on facilitative relationships. He explored the notion of student-centred teaching in Client-Centered Therapy (1951: 384-429). There, as Barrett-Lennard (1998: 184) notes, he offers several general principles. These include: Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 16 1.\t We cannot teach another person directly; we can only facilitate his learning. 2.\t The structure and organization of the self appear to become more rigid under threat. 3.\t The educational climate which most effectively promotes significant learning is one in which: a.\t threat to the self of the learner is reduced to a minimum, and b.\t differentiated perception of the field of experience is facilitated. All those who had the experience of being a student of Carl Rogers, including myself, deem Carl a gifted teacher. His way of being was always congruent with his theories, he was always candid with us, openly admitting his limitations and mistakes. His paper \u2018The interpersonal relationship in the facilitation of learning\u2019 is an important statement of this orientation (Kirschenbaum and Henderson 1990). The purpose of Person-Centered Education is to protect and promote a student\u2019s innate creative capacities for learning from their experiences, to promote wholeness and integration in the individual by focusing on the student\u2019s personal growth and development of creative and competent members of society, who are able to contribute effectively to the life of their community. The role of the student-centered teacher is a professional commitment to facilitate learning and to embrace effective, democratic and value-based education. The teacher should also have the capacity to share her/his passion about learning, and relate to students with respect, empathy and congruence. The teacher needs to be capable of being in touch with herself, her students, the members of her community and the world and have the needed skills and attitudes and motivations to be a facilitator of learning, an effective mentor promoting creativity and autonomy, capable of helping students develop their personal and social skills and not just absorb notions. Person/Student-Centered educated learners learn much more and better when compared to those who are traditionally educated. They take responsibility for their own personal development, for development of social, personal and problem-solving skills, for learning to learn, for learning from mistakes, for contributing to a cooperative and tolerant school ethos and for learning how to relate to herself/himself and others with respect, empathy and congruence. Student-Centered education promotes self-regulation, by helping students to understand and manage their own learning and to choose worthy and attainable goals (Pintrich, 2000). David Aspy and Flora Roebuck carried out the largest field study ever done in 42 U.S. states and 7 countries, in the 1970s and 80s, over a 12-year period, focusing on what led students to achievement, creativity, more critical thinking and interactivity, less violence, and more teacher and student satisfaction. Their research supported the earlier findings of Carl Rogers\u2019: the most effective teachers were empathic, caring or prizing their students, and were authentic or genuine in their classroom (Aspy and Roebuck, 1977, 1983). 17 Reinhard and Anne Marie Taush replicated the research in large numbers of classrooms in Germany and showed similar positive findings (Tausch & Tausch 1963/1998). In 2007 Cornelius-White and in 2010 Jeffrey Cornelius-White and Adam Harbaugh published a very large meta-analysis on learner-centered education including in their analysis the studies on person-centered or humanistic education done since 1948. Their findings also corroborated the earlier findings of Carl Rogers and of Aspy and Roebuck, underlining the fact that a student-centered education that fosters learner-centered instructions works better than traditional education, facilitates positive results with students of different gender, ethnicity and cultures. Further research has confirmed the positive results (Cornelius-White, 2007); (Cornelius-White & Harbaugh, 2010); (Anyanwu & Iwuamadi, 2015); (Requena- Carrion, et al. 2010). Among the positive results are, better achievement of educational goals, better attendance, more student satisfaction, better morale, better self-image, more critical thinking, better problem solving, better relationships between students in the classroom and also outside school hours and less destructive behaviors or dropouts. (Cornelius-White & Harbaugh, 2010). What is relevant is that person/student-centered education has positive effects on all levels and grades of education (Kember, 2009), and also shows excellent results when applied to so called \u201cdry\u201d technical fields like molecular biology, biochemistry, pharmacology etc. (Knight & Wood, 2005); (Kemm & Dantas, 2007); (Costa, 2014), or when one is using the new computer assisted hybrid or e-learning forms of educational offerings (Motschnig-Pitrik & Derntl, 2002). Of no secondary importance are the facts that ineffective education imposes serious costs to individual citizens, their families, communities and nations and that more and more of these relevant socio-economic costs as well as the gains derived from improving education are scientifically assessed (KPMG Foundation, 2006); (OECD 2010). The need to redesign policies and practices in education and better train the teachers has been underlined by many authors for a long time: (Dewey, 1897, 1924); (Montessori, 1912, 1914, 1936); (Freire, 1970); (Rogers, 1965, 1969, 1977, 1980, 1983); (Foucault, 1980); (Lambert & McCombs, 1997); (Morin, 2001, 2007a, 2007b); (Levine, 2002); (Armstrong, 2012); (McCombs, 2013). The student-centered approach requires a willingness from teachers to share their power and have more trust in their students\u2019 innate capacity and motivation for learning. feelings, the concept and the experience, the idea and the meaning. When we learn in that way, we are whole.\u201d \u2013 Rogers 1983 p.20 Research confirms that the person-/student-centered approach is more effective than traditional education even in the case of adult education. Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 18 Malcolm Knowles is one of the outstanding figures of adult education who was influenced by the work of Carl Rogers. Knowles called his approach to adult education \u201cAndragogy\u201d. He was influenced by the ideas and work of Carl Rogers at the University of Chicago,  where he was doing his Master\u2019s at the time Rogers was a very popular professor; Knowles enrolled in a seminar under Arthur Shedlin, an associate of Rogers, where he had a significant experience: \u201c It was exhilarating. I began to sense what it means to get turned on to learning. I began to think about what it means to be a facilitator of learning rather than a teacher \u201d (Knowles, 1984 pp.14). Jarvis has compiled a comparison of the assumptions of traditional pedagogy and andragogy as formulated by Malcolm Knowles (Jarvis, 1987). Traditional Pedagogy : The learner is dependent, the teacher directs what, when and how a subject is learned and tests what has been learned. \u2022\t The learner\u2019s experience has very little worth. Hence, teaching methods are didactic. \u2022\t Readiness to learn: students should learn what society expects them to learn; for this reason the curriculum is standardized. \u2022\t Orientation to learning: geared towards the acquisition of subject matter; the curriculum is organized by subjects. Andragogy: promotes independence, self-direction; the teacher encourages and facilitates self-regulation. \u2022\t The learner\u2019s experience is a rich resource for learning. Teaching methods include discussion, brainstorming, problem-solving etc. \u2022\t Readiness to learn:  People learn what they need to know, so that learning programmes are organized around real life application. \u2022\t Orientation to learning: Learning should be based on experiences, since people are performance-centered in their learning. Knowles based his work on Carl Rogers\u2019 ideas but he was also influenced by Kurt Lewin and others. The following assumptions show how strong the influence of Rogers was on his work: 1.\t Self-concept: As a person matures his/her self-concept moves from one of being a dependent personality toward one of being a self-directed human being. 2.\t Adult Learner Experience: As a person matures he/she accumulates a growing amount of experience that becomes a continuously increasing resource for learning. 3.\t Readiness to Learn: As a person matures his/her readiness to learn becomes oriented increasingly to the developmental tasks of his/her social roles. 19 4.\t Orientation to Learning: As a person matures his/her time perspective changes from one of postponed application of knowledge to immediacy of application, and accordingly his/her orientation toward learning shifts from being centered on the topic to being centered on problem solving. 5.\t Motivation to Learn: As a person matures the motivation to learn becomes internal (Knowles 1984:12). 1.\t Adults need to be involved in the planning and evaluation of instruction received. 2.\t Experience which includes learning from mistakes, provides the basis for learning activities. 3.\t Adults are most interested in learning subjects that have immediate relevance and impact on their job or personal life. 4.\t Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented. computer training: 1.\t We need to explain the reasons why specific things are being taught. 2.\t Instruction should be task-oriented instead of promoting learning by rote; learning activities should be in the context of common tasks to be performed. 3.\t Instruction should take into account the wide range of different backgrounds of learners; learning materials and activities should allow for different levels/types of previous experience with computers. 4.\t Since adults are self-directed, instruction should allow learners to discover knowledge for themselves without depending on other people; guidance and help will be provided if the learner makes mistakes and asks for help. Knowles considered adult education as an excellent setting for civic learning, as occasions where people relate to and interact with each other and become useful laboratories of democracy and cooperation. Knowles stressed that adults need: \u2022\t a mature understanding of themselves, their needs, motivations, interests, capacities, and goals. They need to accept and respect themselves for what and who they are, while striving to grow. \u2022\t an attitude of acceptance, love, and respect toward themselves and others. Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 20 \u2022\t to learn to distinguish between people and ideas, and to challenge ideas without judging the person. \u2022\t to learn to live in the here and now, accepting the fact that change is the ever present reality and develop awareness and the capacity for learning from every experience. \u2022\t to learn to react to the causes, and not the symptoms of behavior. Have an understanding that solutions to problems lie in their causes, not in their symptoms. \u2022\t to learn how to facilitate their growth and develop their potentialities. This will contribute to their wellbeing and benefit society. \u2022\t to actualize one\u2019s own potentials requires various relational skills, social, vocational, civic, artistic, and the like. Effective education aims to facilitate learners\u2019 potentialities at the bio-psycho-social-spiritual levels. Furthermore, adults need to understand the essential values of human experience and be familiar with the heritage of knowledge, the great traditions of the world in which they live. They should understand and respect the values that bind communities together. Adults need to understand social realities, be aware of them and be an active and mature agent of social change. Knowles stated that there is ample evidence that self-directed learning offers several advantages: people who are proactive learners learn more and better than reactive learners; people who passively wait to be taught \u201center into learning more purposefully and with greater motivation. They also tend to retain and make use of what they learn better and longer than do the reactive learners\u201d (Knowles 1975: 14). Self-directed learning is more in tune with the natural processes of psychological development. \u201cAn essential aspect of maturing is developing the ability to take increasing responsibility for our own lives\u2014to become increasingly self-directed\u201d (Knowles 1975: 15). Thirdly, more and more educational programs have placed more responsibility on the learners to be active learners: \u201cStudents entering into these programs without having learned the skills of self-directed inquiry will experience anxiety, frustration, and often failure, and so will their teachers\u201d (Knowles 1975: 15). Furthermore, social reality has been changing at an accelerating pace; it is no longer realistic to define the purpose of education as a mere transmission of what is known to new \u201cIt is no longer realistic to define the purpose of education as a mere transmission of what is known to new generations. The main purpose of education must now be to develop the skills of inquiry to learn how to learn.\u201d 21 generations. The main purpose of education must now be to develop the skills of inquiry to learn how to learn. Malcolm Knowles proposed a five step model to promote student-centered adult learning: 1.\t diagnosing learning needs. 2.\t formulating learning needs. 3.\t identifying human resources for learning. 4.\t choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies. 5.\t evaluating learning outcomes. Knowles was the first to chart the rise of the adult education movement in the United States, the first to develop a statement of informal adult education practice and the first to attempt a comprehensive theory of adult education. He was an innovator and a key figure in adult education throughout the Western world in the XX century (Jarvis 1987: 185). There are several barriers to the restructuring of the field of traditional education and those barriers are to be identified, understood and resolved if the efforts to promote a more effective education are to be successful. The goal is to improve our education system in order to be able to offer a more effective education, an education based on reality, and which is scientifically grounded on how people learn and develop their potentialities. We need to understand the obstacles and defense mechanisms that impede change and why the factual politics of education are often incongruent with the declared educational goals. Do we have the political will to change obsolete education? John Dewey eloquently stated that the problem with education is that there are too many teachers and very few facilitators of learning. The teachers\u2019 skills are socially construed, so to promote change effectively it is counterproductive just to criticize teachers for being teacher-centered educators, since society trained them to be so. We need to retool teachers\u2019 education and promote change and undertake the training of traditional educators to make them motivated enough to become effective student-centered educators. This process needs to be a promotion of change on a win-win basis. It would be quite incongruent not to consider educators as persons who need to be respected, understood and facilitated in their learning new skills as educators. We need to understand how effectively learning of educators can be facilitated and how decision makers can become part of the solution, not part of the problem as in obsolete education. Another way to be person/student-centered is to apply to the field of education the knowledge that is emerging from the advancement of research in neuroscience (Goswami, 2004); (Blakemore & Frith, 2005); (Caine and Caine, 2011); (Brunnhuber, 2016). The emerging field of educational neuroscience is helping us better understand why person/ student-centered education is effective; neuroscience research confirms that learning Volume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016 22 outcomes are not solely determined by the environment, and that personal/biological factors are also significant variables. Therefore, in order to be effective, education needs to be person-centered, respecting and valorizing individual differences. Taking the Person-Centered Approach Institute (IACP) as an example, the post- graduate courses there are organized as a learning community where professors and students intentionally create a facilitative climate of learning and collaboratively strive to achieve common goals. Every day there is an encounter group and students can call for a community meeting if they want to address any specific problem or issue. Exams and assessments are not of the traditional kind: the students orally share in the classroom their written self-evaluation focused on 3 levels of their learning experience: to know, to learn to do and to be. They receive their peers\u2019 and the professors\u2019 feedback orally. In addition, each professor and tutor receives feedback from the students. The secretaries and the facilities are also evaluated by the students with the use of anonymous questionnaires that the students are asked every time to improve or modify. Suggestions for improvements are given to each professor, tutor and secretary as well as to each facility. The feedback of the students is discussed in a staff meeting after which the  course director and the local IACP branch director communicate to the students the changes and improvements that they are willing and able to implement with the students\u2019 active involvement. During written exams, the questions are distributed and at the end of the allotted time the students are asked not to turn in their papers as is done in traditional education, but to take them home and correct them by consulting the literature and then edit their answers if necessary and send their papers to their tutor and professor. Promoting change cannot be done in a mechanistic reductionist way as Jasanoff (2011) reminds us. Different civic epistemologies shape different responses to anthropogenic changes (Norgaard, 2011): the construction of public knowledge varies from culture to culture and from community to community, different epistemologies and different hermeneutics need to be kept in mind for the promotion of change because what may work in a community may not  be automatically effective in another. In order to be effective, the new paradigm of education should avoid becoming a one way worldview. As it is important to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity, it is also important to protect human creativity and the plurality of narratives and cultures, all united in their common goal and effort to protect and respect all life forms.

The Problems we must face \n\u201cThe trouble with our times is that the future is not what it used to be.\u201d\n \u2013 Paul  Val\u00e9ry\nWe, the children of the Anthropocene Era, are entering the 4th industrial revolution and \nthe impact is going to be pervasive and of greater magnitude compared to the previous \nindustrial revolutions. The incoming changes, approaching at an accelerating speed, will \nbe impacting everything and everybody and blurring the lines between the physical, digital, \nand biological spheres; they will affect the bio-psycho-social dimensions, our narratives \nand even what it means to be human. If we are not farsighted and do not plan effectively, the \nresults could be very problematic for all life forms on Earth. If we manage the 4th industrial \nrevolution with the same blindness and forms of denial with which we managed the previous \nindustrial revolutions, the negative effects will be exponential. But we are not impotent; we \ncan manage this revolution wisely, increase the positive effects and mitigate the negative \nones since technology is designed, made and managed by us. We cannot afford to be na\u00efve \nand just hope that technology will automatically improve our lives; new and effective tools \nfor understanding and governing such epochal changes are needed apart from the need for \nfacilitating awareness in all stakeholders about the dangers and opportunities offered by \nthe incoming changes. Effective forms of education are crucial. The fourth revolution could \nbe an unprecedented success if we are able to manage complex processes and at the same \ntime assure that each innovation will not only bring change but also foster a more humane, \nsustainable, peaceful and prosperous future for all. For effective governance, we need \neffective tools. One much-needed tool is the clear understanding of the crucial role played \nby the processes by which we humans construe experiences of ourselves, of others and other \nlife forms. In other words, most of us still think we live in a unidimensional reality, but we \nlive in a socially construed consensus reality, ignoring which may create crucial blind spots, \ndiminish our coping capacities and resilience, thereby generating humongous self-inflicted \ndamages. To meet these challenges, effective and scientifically validated person- and people-\ncentered educational approaches are necessary. They will play a crucial role in enabling \nus to stop wasting our best resources\u2014human and natural capital\u2014and will facilitate us to \nachieve effective and sustainable governance.\nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n2\nThere is a large amount of scientific evidence that our present relationship with ourselves, \nothers and the planet we live in is the main variable influencing all life forms and the planet \nitself, a dramatic epochal change referred to by scientists as the Anthropocene (Crutzen and \nStoermer, 2000). \nThe human population\u2019s exponential increase favored by the first, second and third \nindustrial revolutions in numbers, production and consumption behaviors has produced such \ndramatic and exorbitant costs to ourselves and all life forms. The United Nations estimates \nthat at the present pace, the number of people on the planet is set to rise to 9.7 billion in 2050 \nwith 2 billion aged over 60 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, \nPopulation Division, 2015).\nAccording to the recent The Living Planet Report, the problems are getting worse as \npopulations and consumption keep growing faster than technology\u2019s ability to find new ways \nof expanding what can be produced from the natural world. This led the report to predict that \nby 2030, if nothing changes, mankind would need two planets to sustain its present lifestyle. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO, 2012) reminds us that the destruction and \npollution of the environment have dire consequences on people\u2019s health: globally, 23% of \nall deaths and 22% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are estimated to be attributed \nto the environment.\nIn total, the number of deaths linked to the environment amounts to 12.6 million per year \n(based on 2012 data). This burden could be lessened significantly by reducing risks (WHO \n2016a). Unfortunately, the risks and their impact are rising, the latest WHO report in 2016 \ndramatically shows that 92% of the world\u2019s population lives in places where air quality \nlevels exceed WHO safety limits, which means that 9 out of 10 people live in countries \nwith excessive air pollution. Every year, 3 million deaths are associated with exposure to \noutdoor air pollution. Over 4 million people die prematurely from illness due to household \nair pollution (WHO 2016c; WHO 2016d).\nThere are also other kinds of mounting problems around the world and in particular in \nthe most prosperous countries. Paradoxically, on the one hand the world has had since the \nSecond World War an exponential increase in the availability of material goods, services and \nconnectivity, and on the other hand, an equally significant increase in the number of people \nthat feel disconnected, depressed or burdened by narcissism, consumerism, self-exploitation \nand lack of meaning (Han, 2014).\nThere is scientific evidence that depression predisposes people to myocardial infarction \n(heart attack) and diabetes, both of which conversely increase the likelihood of depression. \nMany risk factors such as low socioeconomic status, alcohol abuse and stress are common \nto both mental disorders and other non-communicable diseases. There is also substantial \nconcurrence of mental disorders and substance use disorders. Taken together, mental, \nneurological and substance use disorders exact a high toll; they accounted for 13% of the total \nglobal burden of disease in the year 2004. Depression alone accounts for 4.3% of the global \nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n3\nburden of disease and is the single largest cause of disability worldwide, 11% of all years \nlived with disability globally, particularly considering women. The economic consequences \nof these health losses are equally large (WHO, 2013).\nThe WHO reminds us that every year more than 800,000 people end their own lives \nand there are many more people who attempt suicide. Every suicide is a tragedy that affects \nfamilies, communities and entire countries. Globally, it was the second leading cause of \ndeath among 15-29 year-olds in 2012. The number of suicides increases during moments of \ncrisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems. \nIn addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse, loss and a sense of isolation is \nstrongly associated with suicidal behavior. Suicide rates are also high amongst vulnerable \ngroups who experience discrimination, such as refugees, migrants, indigenous peoples, \nLGBTI persons and prisoners (WHO 2016b).\nTo make things worse, the effects of climate change, such as the acidification of the \noceans, the desertification of large parts of the planet, the increasing deforestation and \ndestruction of biodiversity, interact with other explosive realities. There are still an enormous \nnumber of people suffering from hunger, ill health, wars, terrorism, violence, unequal access \nto resources and opportunities, racism and many forms of discrimination and injustice. Many \npeople are forced to leave their homes and countries due to warfare and ethnic or religious \nfanaticism that enlarge the growing numbers of refugees and migrants, which in turn creates \nan escalating spiral whereby they become the innocent targets of fear and bigotry in nations \nwhere they seek refuge.\nA mounting number of scientists warn us that we are fast reaching the tipping point, \nwhere mitigation and/or reversal of trends will not be within our reach if we do not act \npromptly and effectively (IPCC, 2007, 2013, 2014).\nThe fourth industrial revolution could help us exit from this human-produced quagmire, \nonly if we are capable of effective planning and governance. \nFor sure the fourth industrial revolution will create new problems. It is estimated that \nmassive unemployment of unskilled workers and the disappearance of some jobs becoming \nautomated by computerized machines will be one of the effects of the changes looming ahead \nthat we will need to deal with: The International Labour Organization (ILO) has estimated \nthat in the next 10-20 years, the number of jobs threatened by new technologies will be \naround 47% of the total jobs in the United States and between 40% and 60% in Europe \n(Degryse, 2016).  \nRising inequalities is another big problem. According to Credit Suisse\u2019s Global Wealth \nReport 2015, the richest 1% of the population now owns half of all household wealth. \nOxfam\u2019s new report states that 62 individuals control more assets than the poorer half of \nthe world\u2019s population. Researchers such as Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found \nthat unequal societies tend to be more violent, have higher numbers of people in prison, \nexperience greater levels of mental illness, have lower life expectancies and lower levels of \ntrust. These inequalities will create even more fears and backlash against change. The rise \nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n4\nin interconnectedness will bring rising dangers on security, cyber terrorism and likely create \na 1984-like scenario; there is also the risk that the cyber revolution may deprive us of our \nprivacy right, creating some planetary Big Brother effect (Maynard, 2015). \nAll these smart machines and smart customized services can become self-inflicted forms \nof destruction of human capital if we do not plan the Internet of Things wisely or design \nsmart machines to be not only smart, but also wise and people-centered.\nOf course we all enjoy the new opportunities of being connected, having access to \nconnect to people and services\u2014undreamed of until a few years ago\u2014that the technological \nmultinationals are offering us for free. At the same time these new opportunities go \nhand in hand with profound changes that may also bring about some boomerang effects: \nVarious nations have lost technological sovereignty without which their economic and \ncultural sovereignty have been greatly reduced. The artificial intelligence power that some \nmultinationals are acquiring simply by sucking up the data of millions of people that are \nusing their free services does not have equals, but this kind of innovation, for some new \nmedia sociologist like Evgeny Morozov, brings a risk of democracy being replaced by a \nfuturistic scenario of technological Big Data feudalism (Morozov 2013). It is obvious that \nin all these scenarios, prevention is far more feasible and less costly than to wait and see and \neventually being forced to do emergency repair jobs when it is too late.  \n2. What to do \nWe can do several things for planning and governing the fourth industrial revolution in a \npeople-centered and sustainable way; they all have a common denominator: to ensure that \nthe planned changes are person-, people- and community-centered and sustainable. It is \nimperative to identify the barriers, to achieve these goals and work effectively to identify, \nremove or reduce the barriers (Norgaard, 2011); (Zucconi, 2013, 2016).\n\u201cYou know, the principle of empathy gives broader meaning, by the way, to Dr. \nKing\u2019s philosophy of nonviolence...\nIt seems like we got an empathy shortage, an empathy deficit. More serious than \nthe federal budget deficit. We\u2019ve become so cynical that it almost seems naive to \nbelieve that we can understand each other across the gulf of race, or class or region \nor religion...\u201d\nBarack Obama, Martin Luther King Day, Chicago IL, \n                      Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, January 21, 2002\n\u201cOur relationship with ourselves, others and the world is an \nimportant determinant of our mental, physical, and social \nhealth.\u201d\nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n5\nI strongly believe that some of the variables that will effectively foster a more humane and \nsustainable future are:\n\u2022\t More awareness\n\u2022\t More empathy\n\u2022\t More capacity for respecting oneself, others and the world\n\u2022\t More responsibility (in the sense of the ability to respond) \nSince reality is socially construed, in order to have a fourth industrial revolution that will \nprotect and promote human and natural capital, we need to educate and empower everybody \nto make their contribution to achieve this goal.\n3. Create and Use Effective Tools to Promote Sustainable Change \nOur relationship with ourselves, others and the world is an important determinant of our \nmental, physical, and social health. When people and societies are alienated from parts of \nthemselves, they relate to others and the planet in alienated and distorted ways.\nFor example, at present, profit is calculated in a mechanistic reductionist way, the so called \n\u201cbottom line\u201d; at the national level we still use the Gross National Product, whose standards \ncompletely ignore the destruction of human and natural capital. With a more realistic and \nsustainable approach there are at least 3 variables that account for the so-called Triple Bottom \nLine (TBL) which measures economic, ecological and social results. The Quadruple Bottom \nLine (QBL) also takes into consideration cultural aspects like governance (Zucconi, 2013).\nRecently, an Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI) has been formulated. It has a broader way of \nmeasuring natural capital, such as forests; produced capital, such as roads and factories; and \nhuman capital, which includes levels of education, knowledge, and creativity. Preliminary \nfindings indicate that it is possible to trace changes in the components of wealth by country \nand link these to economic growth, and the impact of declines or increases in natural capital \nas an economic productive base (UNU-IHDP, 2012). Effective economic growth can be \nattained only through ecologically conscious green or blue economy (Pauli, 2010). \nWe need to apply effective metrics and create new ones. We need to use in future planning \nand project management some effective human capital and environmental impact assessment \nscales, or use tools already available like the Health Impact Assessment (HIA) to measure \nand predict health consequences (WHO 2016a). If such assessments are performed at the \n\u201cPerson-centered Approach focuses on health and not on illness, \non capacities rather than on limitations; empowers and promotes \nlearning, well-being and resilience by facilitating the development \nof the potentialities of individuals, groups and organizations.\u201d\nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n6\nplanning stage, we can have projects with a focus on sustainability, people-centeredness, \nquality, vulnerability and resilience factors.\n4. Use Scientifically Validated People-Centered Tools\nTo better manage the present situation, we do not need to start from scratch, many effective \ntools are already in existence and they have ample scientific validation for their efficacy and \nefficiency. Here is a partial list of some of them:\n\u2022\t The Person-Centered Approach is a scientifically proven effective way to create \nsolutions on a win-win basis. The Person-Centered Approach (PCA) is a systemic, \nholistic approach applied successfully in interpersonal relationships including conflict \nresolution. PCA focuses on health and not on illness, on capacities rather than on \nlimitations; empowers and promotes learning, well-being and resilience by facilitating \nthe development of the potentialities of individuals, groups and organizations. PCA \nhelps people to grow, learn self-regulation and take responsibility for what they do rather \nthan fostering dependency.\n\u2022\t The Person-Centered Planning (PCP) is another scientifically sound and process-\noriented approach designed to empower people. It focuses on the people and their needs \nby putting them in charge of defining the direction of their lives. PCP is being applied \nsuccessfully in many settings and in particular in the design and management of health \nand special needs facilities.\n\u2022\t The People-Centered Approach (PeCA) is a scientifically validated, interdisciplinary \nand intersectoral approach designed to be employed in large scale projects focused \non fostering the maximum level of effectiveness in protecting and promoting human \necologies and natural ecosystems and promoting sustainable change. The People-\nCentered Approach (PeCA) is a values-oriented approach based on equal rights, deep \nrespect for all forms of life, cultures and traditions. Lately, even the International Labour \nOrganization is recommending the use of People-Centered Approaches (Kiniger-\nPassigli and Biondi, 2015). The PeCA promotes empathic understanding, mutual respect \nand effective communication and collaboration among different stakeholders through \nactions of empowerment and resilience. \n5. Identifying the Barriers to Sustainable Person-Centered Change\nNotwithstanding the seriousness of the threats, and the urgency to deal with them, many \nobstacles remain in the way of effective and sustainable governance at the local, national and \ninternational levels. The lack of awareness of the magnitude of the problems and the changes \nneeded in the behaviors of all the stakeholders to manage the serious mounting challenges \nfacing humanity is in part due to barriers of a sociological and psychological nature that \nimpede effective coordinated actions of various stakeholders. The underlying mechanism at \nwork in the promotion or resistance to change or the denial of threats like climate warming \nvaries from culture to culture: how reality is socially construed and how individuals and \norganizations construe their experiences and narratives are relevant for the understanding of \nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n7\nthe promotion of change needed to promote sustainable governance and to deal effectively \nwith the barriers to change (Zucconi, 2013, 2016).\n6. Reality \n\u201cReality isn\u2019t what it used to be\u201d                                                                            \n\u2013 Walter Truett Anderson (1990)\nIn the age of globalization and of growing complexity, in order to meet the challenges of \nour present and future, we need new and effective ways to facilitate the capacity of awareness \nand integration in our ways of knowing and behaving. We need to foster a new socio-\npsychological literacy for billions of people; a socio-psychological compass and a holistic/\nsystemic way of being in relationship with ourselves, others and the planet, to enable us to \nnavigate the rippling currents of change. \nNowadays, decision makers and experts seem not to take notice in their blueprints of the \ngovernance of how individuals, communities, societies and cultures are fully immersed in the \nways they call reality and perceive it, which in effect is not quite what they intend\u2014reality \nas an objective fact. What they call reality is the way individuals construe their experiences \nof the so called reality at the personal and societal levels.\nThe ways individuals and communities construe their experiences can be very useful \nin helping them cope effectively with their circumstances, but only if they foster a clear \nunderstanding of how problems are generated and how they can be effectively resolved or \nmitigated.\nAs the history of humankind amply shows, the construction of experience mistakenly \ntaken for objective reality can, even with the best intentions, create destructive boomerang \neffects, immense sufferings and has even resulted in the downfall of some empires and \ncivilizations in the past.\nThe way we still use some dysfunctional metrics to measure growth is one of the many \nexamples of how we make ourselves blind to the obvious: We can still read in the daily news \nthat the economy is growing even when society is bent on effectively destroying its human \nand natural capital, impacting present and future generations negatively and behaving like \ncancerous cells multiplying in a living organism.\nDrawing national borders with a ruler might look neat in a geo-political map of post-\ncolonial nations but that blindness to reality will provoke chaos and immense suffering for \ngenerations and spread to larger areas, as the present social pandemic of violence seems to \nindicate. Only blindness can explain the recent behaviors that some of the most advanced \nnations have adopted in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and the Middle East. Only blindness can explain \nthe lack of preparation for the consequences from the dislocation of immense numbers of \npeople running away for life from their war torn countries, risking their lives to have a chance \nin more safe and prosperous countries, but who in turn experience a rise in fear of insecurity, \nwhich generates the rise of populist politics, racism and violence.\nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n8\n\u201cThe world of everyday life is not only taken for granted as reality by the ordinary \nmembers of society in the subjectively meaningful conduct of their lives. It is a world \nthat originates in their thoughts and actions, and is maintained as real by these.\u201d                       \n                           \u2013 Berger & Luckmann,  1966, page 19\nWhat is perceived as real varies from society to society and is produced, transmitted and \nconserved through social processes. Our perception of reality is largely modeled from beliefs \nand assumptions that are typical of the society and culture to which we belong. What we \nknow, what we consider true and right, the behaviors we adopt, all are influenced by the social/\ncultural environment in which we live. This process happens through the internalization of \n\u201creality\u201d that occurs during the socialization process. \nWe need new and effective ways of coping with our rapidly changing realities. A way to \nbecome aware of how we construe our experiences of what we call reality, the relationship \nwith ourselves, the others, the world. We need to foster at every level of society an awareness \nof the social construction of reality, of our powers and responsibilities for the present and the \nfuture of humankind and the whole planet (Anderson, 1990, 1997, 2016).\nSocio-cultural and personal constructs are the ways in which communities and individuals \nconstrue their experiences at the emotional and cognitive levels. The social and personal \nconstructs are interacting with and influencing the social and individual dimensions all the \ntime. \nSome of the variables influencing us are:\n\u2022\t Our relationships with significant others\u2014parents, siblings etc., by the roles that they \ngive us and by the ways of being (constructs) we introject which become part of our \npersonality, influencing how we relate with ourselves, others and the world.  \n\u2022\t The social environment through the imposition of societal norms.\n\u2022\t The narratives we absorb from kids\u2019 fables, cartoons, movies, TV, social media, popular \nheroes.\n\u2022\t The formal and informal education we receive.\nFor all the above reasons, we need to educate everybody to understand the social and \nindividual processes that lie at the base of the construction of narratives that we call reality. \nWhat we call reality is a consensus reality and is largely shaped by our beliefs. If our socially \nconstrued and personally construed beliefs are made conscious and their values made explicit, \n\u201cWe need to foster at every level of society an awareness of the \nsocial construction of reality, of our powers and responsibilities \nfor the present and the future of humankind and the whole \nplanet.\u201d\nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n9\nwe can examine them and verify if some of our beliefs are obsolete or dysfunctional, so we \ncan update and replace dysfunctional ways of thinking and feeling with more functional ones, \na process that is characteristic of fully functioning persons (Rogers, 1965); (Zucconi, 2013).\n7. Effective Education \nNo other institution in the world is as powerful in shaping our future as education, since it \nis only during the educational process that much of the social construction of reality occurs. \nEducation is the process by which the minds of the new generation are shaped about what is \nreal (Dewey, 1897, 1924); (Rogers, 1969, 1983); (Freire, 1970); (Foucault, 1980); (Zimring, \n1994); (Morin, 2001, 2007a, 2007b); (Rogers, Lyon & Tausch, 2014); (Zucconi, 2013, 2016).\nFrancis Bacon stated that knowledge is power. Most people will agree with that, but for \nmany, it is still not automatically self-evident that to have faulty knowledge is to lose power \nand is a lethally effective form of socially self-inflicted harm. Present traditional education \noften stifles our natural learning abilities unintentionally. \nAll lifeforms\u2019 survival depends on effective and rapid learning as to how to adapt \ntheir behaviors to environmental changes. We need to retool and upgrade all levels of our \neducation. Formal and informal education at any level needs to offer us the knowledge, skills \nand attitudes that will enable us to survive and even prosper in the present period of change \nby learning the needed skills for coping and governing in peaceful and sustainable ways \nthrough the turbulent scenarios of the Anthropocene Era.\n\u201cEducation and health go hand in hand. \nThe evidence demonstrating the links is overwhelming.\u201d\n\u2013 Margaret Chan\nDirector-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), MDG Summit: Remarks at \nRoundtable 2:  Meeting the Goals for Health & Education, New York, September 20, 2010\nEducation is the wellspring of our wellbeing, prosperity and resilience; it is through \neducation that we human beings can transcend some of the physical limits of biological \nevolution. There is ample scientific evidence of the connection between health and education, \neducation and prosperity (KPMG Foundation, 2006); (Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2006); (Every \nChild a Chance Trust 2009); (OECD, 2010); (WHO, 2013, 2016a, 2016b). \n8. The Effects of Education on Health\nCutler & Lleras-Muney report that an additional four years of education lowers five-year \nmortality by 1.8 percentage points; it also reduces the risk of heart disease by 2.16 percentage \npoints, and the risk of diabetes by 1.3 percentage points. The significant association between \neducation and health has been observed in many countries and time periods, and in a wide \nvariety of health measures. The differences between educational inequalities are significant: \nin the U.S. in 1999, the age-adjusted mortality rate of high school dropouts aged 25 to 64 was \nmore than twice as large as the mortality rate of those with some college education (Cutler \n& Lleras-Muney, 2006). \nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n10\nNot only is education an important social determinant of health, but higher levels of \neducation help to create healthier, more cohesive, prosperous and resilient communities and \nnations. The benefits of education include better levels of social engagement, an important \nvariable of cohesive, safer and healthier societies. At the individual level, the knowledge, \npersonal and social skills provided through education better equip individuals to access and \nuse information and services to maintain and improve their own health and their family\u2019s \n(Feinstein et al. 2003).\nTo be more effective, education needs to be people-centered and empower people to be \nin contact with themselves, others and the world, instead of stifling the natural human capital \nas often is the case with traditional education.  Effective education needs to protect and \npromote the enhancement and actualization of values like empathy, respect, deep contact, \ncreativity and resilience (Rogers, 1969, 1983); (Gershon & Vincow, 1997); (Lambert & \nMcCombs; 1997); (Catalano & Catalano 1999); (Thorkildsen, 2011); (Zucconi, 2008, 2011, \n2013, 2016); (Costa, 2014). \nIf I am able to relate to myself with respect and empathy, then it is much easier and natural \nfor me to relate to other human beings with respect and empathy, even those with different \nbeliefs and customs. This is not mere wishful thinking, there is ample scientific evidence that \nshows that people who are able to relate to themselves with respect and empathy are not only \nable to relate to other human beings with respect and empathy, but they are better capable of \nbeing in touch, of perceiving life around them and attuning themselves empathically with all \nother life forms. This way of being is not exceptional, it is typical of mentally healthy human \nbeings (Rogers, 1951, 1961, 1969, 1977, 1983); (Zucconi, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016); (Silani, \nZucconi & Lamm, 2013).\nUnfortunately centuries of spreading alienation have made lack of contact and chronic \nreification \u201cnormal\u201d. Those alienated individuals that relate to themselves, others and the \nworld, like something that can be turned into a commodity and sold for monetary gain, are \nconsidered smart and successful by many other equally alienated human beings. The results \nare irresponsible environmental exploitation, social injustice and the destruction of our \nplanet. It is encouraging to see what Pope Francis has pronounced in his encyclical \u2018Laudato \nSi\u2019, an effective call for an \u2018ecological conversion\u2019 of every good Christian, a person who in \nhis/her feelings and behaviors respects every human being and living creature irrespective of \ndifferences. If spiritual and political leaders and opinion makers offer a congruent narrative \nof the vital importance of establishing relationships based on respect and empathy with all \nlife forms, this message would be an excellent teaching and such motivational narratives, if \nintrojected, will have significant positive results.\n\u201cEffective education needs to protect and promote the \nenhancement and actualization of the natural qualities of \n \nempathy, respect, deep contact, creativity and resilience.\u201d\nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n11\nEducation at its best is a bio-psycho-social-spiritual learning experience that promotes our \ncapacities to live a significant existence and develop our potentialities to become creative, \nresilient and productive citizens.\nHow we reorganize education is very important for our present and future, since learning \nis for our species an empowering and adaptive way to accelerate change. Human educational \nactivities and organizations may represent the most important way for humans to ensure \nour own survival and to save our planet. The World Academy of Art & Science (WAAS) \nhas launched a project with its sister institution, the World University Consortium (WUC), \nto create a space open to all the stakeholders to brainstorm and retool education to serve \npeople\u2019s urgent needs and to better cope with present emergencies.*\nAn effective people-centered education is needed to create more aware and resilient \ncitizens who will integrate knowledge, promote collective wisdom, build a sustainable society \nin which duties and responsibilities are equally important as rights and equal opportunities. \n9. Person-Centered, Student-Centered Education\nEducation, apart from family and culture, is one of the fundamental building blocks \nof the social construction of reality; it is more and more evident that we need a paradigm \nchange in traditional education in order to enable people to deal effectively with the mounting \nchallenges facing humanity. \nThis retooling needs to start with our frames of reference. \nWe need to create a new paradigm in education in order to enable education to serve \npeople\u2019s needs and to have relevance in public service, social responsibility, sustainable \ngovernance and development. \nEducation is one of the main narratives to prepare new generations to be an active and \nconstructive part of society and is one of the main carriers of values. Values can be implicit \nor explicit. \nTheorists like John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky, whose collective work \nfocused on how students learn, have laid the groundwork for student-centered learning. Carl \nRogers\u2019 ideas and research on the functioning of human beings have contributed significantly \nto person-centered education, promoting student-centered and lifelong learning throughout \n* See http://wunicon.org\n\u201cWe need to create a new paradigm in education in order to \nenable education to serve people\u2019s needs and to have relevance in \npublic service, social responsibility and sustainable governance \nand development.\u201d\nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n12\none\u2019s lifespan, underlining the importance of teachers to become more effective by helping \n \nthem become facilitators of learning. In order to be effective facilitators of learning, \nteachers need to learn and be capable of creating with the learners a facilitative empowering \nenvironment based on trust, empathy and respect. \nOf course an exhaustive illustration of this topic would require my mentioning many \nmore authors, a task impossible to accomplish in this paper. I just want to add that the \nworld famous pedagogist Maria Montessori was a forerunner of student-centered learning, \nfacilitating preschool children to learn through independent self-directed activities. Malcolm \nKnowles is also one of the major figures in student-centered adult education who has applied \nRogers\u2019 ideas (1975, 1984a, 1984b, 1990).\n\u201cTraditional education ignores or suppresses learner responsibility.\u201d\n   \u2013 Armstrong (2012)\nSelf-determination theory focuses on how an individual\u2019s behavior is self-motivated and \nself-determined. When students are given the opportunity to evaluate their learning, learning \nbecomes an incentive. \nIn the traditional teacher-centered teaching, teachers have been the primary source of \nknowledge. In a student-centered classroom, self-regulation, empowerment and active \nlearning are facilitated.  \n10. Student-Centered Assessment\n\u201cI believe that the testing of the student\u2019s achievements in order to see if he meets \nsome criterion held by the teacher, is directly contrary to the implications of therapy \nfor significant learning.\u201d  \u2013  Carl Rogers\n\u201cI never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can \nlearn.\u201d  \u2013   Albert Einstein\nOne of the most crucial differences between student-centered learning and teacher-\ncentered learning is the assessment. In student-centered learning, students actively participate \nin the evaluation of their learning. Having an assessment process that involves the entire \nlearning community in a sort of action research to measure the learning outcomes is an \nimportant aspect of student-centered education and a significant way to support learning and \nmotivation and an essential variable for assuring the success of the application of student-\ncentered approaches.\n\u201cTalk to me \u2026 and I will forget\nShow me \u2026 and I will remember\nInvolve me \u2026 and I will understand\nStep back \u2026 and I will act.\u201d\n                                      \u2013  Confucius\nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n13\nStudent-centered education fosters transferable skills such as problem-solving, critical \nthinking, and reflective thinking. The revised European Standards and Guidelines for \nQuality Assurance states: \u201cInstitutions should ensure that programmes are delivered in a \nway that encourages students to take an active role in creating the learning process and that \nthe assessment of students reflects this approach.\u201d\nIn Europe, student-centred learning has increased in prominence over the past few \ndecades. The Leuven/Louvain-la-Neuve Ministerial Communiqu\u00e9 (Bologna Process 2009) \nunderlines the relevance of student-centered education for effectively coping with the present \nsocietal changes (Geven & Attard, 2012).\n\u201cEuropean higher education also faces the major challenge and the ensuing opportunities \nof globalization and accelerated technological developments with new providers, new \nlearners and new types of learning. Student-centred learning and mobility will help students \ndevelop the competencies they need in a changing labour market and will empower them to \nbecome active and responsible citizens\u201d (Bologna Process 2009, p. 1).\n11. The Issue of Power Redistribution\nExisting research clearly shows the effectiveness of person-/student-centered education \nat every level and grade but there are some barriers that have slowed down the application \nof this approach; the major obstacles are the so called power issues. Student-centered \nlearning is a process that requires power sharing and responsibilities sharing at the policy \nlevel, administrative level, curriculum development level, assessment and evaluation level, \nclassroom management and relational level. Another important issue determining success \nor failure is the obvious fact that change has to be facilitated effectively by competent \nprofessionals in a systemic way. In the past there have been easily predictable and preventable \nfailures, since one cannot just wish to change a school or an university by calling it student-\ncentered; the staff and the teachers need to be retrained and motivated and in the retooling of \nthe educational institution, the students/learners and all the stakeholders need to be actively \ninvolved in the process. \nTeacher-Centered Learning\nPerson-/Student-Centered Learning\nTeacher has the power\nStudent has less choice\nStudents have a passive role\nEmpowerment of students\nStudent has more choice\nStudents have an active role\nIn order to be effective, projects aimed to facilitate change in an educational institution \nhave to involve actively all the stakeholders, carry out a force field analysis, a feasibility study \nand promote change on a win-win for all base. Never forget that it is not only students that \nbecome better learners if they are understood, respected and empowered, but administrators \nand teachers are human too; they will be better administrators and teachers if their needs, \nambivalence and fears are understood, respected and taken seriously into consideration. In \nother words, a student-centered learning project, in order to succeed, needs to be person- \nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n14\ncentered, involve the whole educational community, thereby becoming a sustainable \npeople-centered project (Zucconi, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016).\nIn Person-Centered Education (PCE), also called student-centered education, values are \nmade explicit to facilitate students to have a critical and proactive role, an effective training \nto make them become fully functioning members of the Polis.  \nThe Person-Centered Approach (PCA) was originated by the late Dr. Carl Rogers. PCA \nis a scientifically validated systemic, holistic approach with applications in all the helping \nprofessions: Psychology, Education, Medicine, Social Work, Management, Intercultural \ncommunication, conflict prevention, etc. \nThe central hypothesis of the Person-Centered Approach is that individuals have within \nthemselves vast resources for self-understanding and for changing their self-concepts, \nbasic attitudes and self-directed behavior, and these resources can be tapped if a climate \nof facilitative psychological conditions is provided. PCA focuses on health, not illness; \non learning, not on teaching; on solutions, not on problems. PCA empowers, rather than \ncures; promotes the development of potentialities of individuals, groups and organizations \nthrough safe and growth-promoting interpersonal relationships characterized by respect, \ntrust, empathic understanding and authenticity. It focuses on supporting people\u2019s creativity \nand resilience, and makes them feel responsible for what they do rather than encouraging \ndependency (Barrett-Lennard,1998); (Zucconi, 2008, 2011, 2013); (Rogers, Lyon & Tausch, \n2014). \n\u201cSo while I still hate to readjust my thinking, still hate to give up old ways of \nperceiving and conceptualizing, yet at some deeper level I have, to a considerable \ndegree, come to realize that these painful reorganizations are what is known as \nlearning.\u201d \u2013  Carl Rogers, On Becoming a Person, 1961\n\u201cThe only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and \nchange.\u201d  \u2013  Carl Rogers                                 \nCarl Rogers has identified some core conditions present in teachers that are effective \nfacilitators of learning and relational capabilities.\n\u201cThe central hypothesis of the Person-Centered Approach is \nthat individuals have within themselves vast resources for \nself-understanding and for changing their self-concepts, basic \nattitudes and self-directed behavior, and these resources can be \ntapped if a climate of facilitative psychological conditions is \nprovided.\u201d\nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n15\n\u201cOver the years, however, the research evidence keeps piling up, and it points \nstrongly to the conclusion that a high degree of empathy in a relationship is possibly \nthe most potent and certainly one of the most potent factors in bringing about change \nand learning.\u201d   \u2013  Carl Rogers\nFor Rogers there are 3 core conditions or capacities or relational attitudes that facilitate the \nprocess of student-centered learning, and they all converge on the capacity to be centered \non the student in a facilitative way: Being genuine, real or congruent; being nonjudgmental \nand able to deeply trust and respect the student and believing in their potentialities; and \nbeing capable of understanding them with empathy, which create a facilitating climate in the \nclassroom and promote effective learning.  \nRealness and capacity of contact in the facilitator of learning. When the facilitator/\nteacher relates to the students as real persons, and maintains a close relationship with the \nlearners without presenting a front or a facade, she/he is much more likely to be effective. \nThis means that the facilitator of learning is congruent, meaning that she/he is in contact \nwith his/her own inner experience, without distorting or negating it in a defensive way: The \nfeelings that she/he is experiencing are available to her/him and she/he is able to live these \nfeelings, be them, and able to communicate them if appropriate in the learning context. It \nmeans real capacity for contact and encounter with oneself and the learner on a person-to-\nperson basis. It means that the facilitator of learning has the capacity and the courage to be \nhonest, real and transparent, it also means that the facilitator of learning has a good capacity \nof contact with himself/herself, others and the world, which indicates a good level of mental \nhealth.\nA nonjudgmental attitude, acceptance, trust, deep respect for the learner are other core \nattitudes needed in effective facilitators of learning. It is an attitude of sincere interest and \nappreciation for the learner, her or his opinions and feelings, a non-possessive caring for the \nlearner, with real acceptance of the other. It is a basic trust, a belief that human nature and the \nlearner are fundamentally trustworthy: so this is for the teacher not just a theory but also her/\nhis existential stance about human beings.\nEmpathic understanding is the third core competency; the capacity of the teacher to \nunderstand the student\u2019s inner experiences, feelings, thoughts and behaviors deeply and \nto communicate to the learner such empathic understanding in a clear, simple, direct and \ndelicate way. \n\u201c\u2026. [Students feel deeply appreciative] when they are simply understood\u2014not \nevaluated, not judged, simply understood from their own point of view, not the \nteacher\u2019s.\u201d  \u2013  Rogers 1967 304-311\nThe strength of Rogers\u2019 approach lies in part in his focus on facilitative relationships. He \nexplored the notion of student-centred teaching in Client-Centered Therapy (1951: 384-429). \nThere, as Barrett-Lennard (1998: 184) notes, he offers several general principles. These \ninclude: \nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n16\n1.\t We cannot teach another person directly; we can only facilitate his learning.\n2.\t The structure and organization of the self appear to become more rigid under threat.\n3.\t The educational climate which most effectively promotes significant learning is one in \nwhich:\na.\t threat to the self of the learner is reduced to a minimum, and \nb.\t differentiated perception of the field of experience is facilitated.             \nAll those who had the experience of being a student of Carl Rogers, including myself, \ndeem Carl a gifted teacher. His way of being was always congruent with his theories, he \nwas always candid with us, openly admitting his limitations and mistakes. His paper \u2018The \ninterpersonal relationship in the facilitation of learning\u2019 is an important statement of this \norientation (Kirschenbaum and Henderson 1990). \nThe purpose of Person-Centered Education is to protect and promote a student\u2019s innate \ncreative capacities for learning from their experiences, to promote wholeness and integration \nin the individual by focusing on the student\u2019s personal growth and development of creative \nand competent members of society, who are able to contribute effectively to the life of their \ncommunity.\nThe role of the student-centered teacher is a professional commitment to facilitate learning \nand to embrace effective, democratic and value-based education. The teacher should also \nhave the capacity to share her/his passion about learning, and relate to students with respect, \nempathy and congruence.\nThe teacher needs to be capable of being in touch with herself, her students, the members \nof her community and the world and have the needed skills and attitudes and motivations to \nbe a facilitator of learning, an effective mentor promoting creativity and autonomy, capable \nof helping students develop their personal and social skills and not just absorb notions.\nPerson/Student-Centered educated learners learn much more and better when compared \nto those who are traditionally educated. They take responsibility for their own personal \ndevelopment, for development of social, personal and problem-solving skills, for learning \nto learn, for learning from mistakes, for contributing to a cooperative and tolerant school \nethos and for learning how to relate to herself/himself and others with respect, empathy \nand congruence. Student-Centered education promotes self-regulation, by helping students \nto understand and manage their own learning and to choose worthy and attainable goals \n(Pintrich, 2000).\nDavid Aspy and Flora Roebuck carried out the largest field study ever done in 42 U.S. \nstates and 7 countries, in the 1970s and 80s, over a 12-year period, focusing on what led \nstudents to achievement, creativity, more critical thinking and interactivity, less violence, \nand more teacher and student satisfaction. Their research supported the earlier findings of \nCarl Rogers\u2019: the most effective teachers were empathic, caring or prizing their students, and \nwere authentic or genuine in their classroom (Aspy and Roebuck, 1977, 1983). \nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n17\nReinhard and Anne Marie Taush replicated the research in large numbers of classrooms \nin Germany and showed similar positive findings (Tausch & Tausch 1963/1998).\nIn 2007 Cornelius-White and in 2010 Jeffrey Cornelius-White and Adam Harbaugh \npublished a very large meta-analysis on learner-centered education including in their analysis \nthe studies on person-centered or humanistic education done since 1948. Their findings also \ncorroborated the earlier findings of Carl Rogers and of Aspy and Roebuck, underlining \nthe fact that a student-centered education that fosters learner-centered instructions works \nbetter than traditional education, facilitates positive results with students of different gender, \nethnicity and cultures. Further research has confirmed the positive results (Cornelius-White, \n2007); (Cornelius-White & Harbaugh, 2010); (Anyanwu & Iwuamadi, 2015); (Requena-\nCarrion, et al. 2010). \n Among the positive results are, better achievement of educational goals, better attendance, \nmore student satisfaction, better morale, better self-image, more critical thinking, better \nproblem solving, better relationships between students in the classroom and also outside \nschool hours and less destructive behaviors or dropouts. (Cornelius-White & Harbaugh, \n2010). What is relevant is that person/student-centered education has positive effects on all \nlevels and grades of education (Kember, 2009), and also shows excellent results when applied \nto so called \u201cdry\u201d technical fields like molecular biology, biochemistry, pharmacology etc. \n(Knight & Wood, 2005); (Kemm & Dantas, 2007); (Costa, 2014), or when one is using the \nnew computer assisted hybrid or e-learning forms of educational offerings (Motschnig-Pitrik \n& Derntl, 2002).\nOf no secondary importance are the facts that ineffective education imposes serious costs \nto individual citizens, their families, communities and nations and that more and more of \nthese relevant socio-economic costs as well as the gains derived from improving education \nare scientifically assessed (KPMG Foundation, 2006); (OECD 2010).\nThe need to redesign policies and practices in education and better train the teachers \nhas been underlined by many authors for a long time: (Dewey, 1897, 1924); (Montessori, \n1912, 1914, 1936); (Freire, 1970); (Rogers, 1965, 1969, 1977, 1980, 1983); (Foucault, 1980); \n(Lambert & McCombs, 1997); (Morin, 2001, 2007a, 2007b); (Levine, 2002); (Armstrong, \n2012); (McCombs, 2013).\nThe student-centered approach requires a willingness from teachers to share their power \nand have more trust in their students\u2019 innate capacity and motivation for learning. \n12. Person/Student-Centered Adult Education \n\u201cSignificant learning combines the logical and the intuitive, the intellect and the \nfeelings, the concept and the experience, the idea and the meaning. When we learn \nin that way, we are whole.\u201d \u2013  Rogers 1983 p.20\nResearch confirms that the person-/student-centered approach is more effective than \ntraditional education even in the case of adult education. \nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n18\nMalcolm Knowles is one of the outstanding figures of adult education who was influenced \nby the work of Carl Rogers.\nKnowles called his approach to adult education \u201cAndragogy\u201d. He was influenced by the ideas \nand work of Carl Rogers at the University of Chicago,  where he was doing his Master\u2019s at \nthe time Rogers was a very popular professor; Knowles enrolled in a seminar under Arthur \nShedlin, an associate of Rogers, where he had a significant experience:  \n\u201cIt was exhilarating. I began to sense what it means to get turned on to learning. \nI began to think about what it means to be a facilitator of learning rather than a \nteacher\u201d (Knowles, 1984 pp.14).\nJarvis has compiled a comparison of the assumptions of traditional pedagogy and \nandragogy as formulated by Malcolm Knowles (Jarvis, 1987).\nTraditional Pedagogy: The learner is dependent, the teacher directs what, when and how a \nsubject is learned and tests what has been learned. \n\u2022\t The learner\u2019s experience has very little worth. Hence, teaching methods are didactic.\n\u2022\t Readiness to learn: students should learn what society expects them to learn; for this \nreason the curriculum is standardized.\n\u2022\t Orientation to learning: geared towards the acquisition of subject matter; the curriculum \nis organized by subjects.\nAndragogy: promotes independence, self-direction; the teacher encourages and facilitates \nself-regulation.\n\u2022\t The learner\u2019s experience is a rich resource for learning. Teaching methods include \ndiscussion, brainstorming, problem-solving etc. \n\u2022\t Readiness to learn:  People learn what they need to know, so that learning programmes \nare organized around real life application. \n\u2022\t Orientation to learning: Learning should be based on experiences, since people are \nperformance-centered in their learning.\nKnowles based his work on Carl Rogers\u2019 ideas but he was also influenced by Kurt Lewin and \nothers. The following assumptions show how strong the influence of Rogers was on his work:\n1.\t Self-concept: As a person matures his/her self-concept moves from one of being a \ndependent personality toward one of being a self-directed human being.\n2.\t Adult Learner Experience: As a person matures he/she accumulates a growing amount of \nexperience that becomes a continuously increasing resource for learning.\n3.\t Readiness to Learn: As a person matures his/her readiness to learn becomes oriented \nincreasingly to the developmental tasks of his/her social roles.\nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n19\n4.\t Orientation to Learning: As a person matures his/her time perspective changes from one \nof postponed application of knowledge to immediacy of application, and accordingly \nhis/her orientation toward learning shifts from being centered on the topic to being \ncentered on problem solving. \n5.\t Motivation to Learn: As a person matures the motivation to learn becomes internal \n(Knowles 1984:12).\n13. Knowles\u2019 4 Principles of Andragogy\nIn 1984, Knowles suggested 4 principles of adult learning:\n1.\t Adults need to be involved in the planning and evaluation of instruction received.\n2.\t Experience which includes learning from mistakes, provides the basis for learning \nactivities.\n3.\t Adults are most interested in learning subjects that have immediate relevance and impact \non their job or personal life.\n4.\t Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented. \n14. Application of Andragogy in Personal Computer Training\nKnowles\u2019 (1984) contributions include andragogy principles for the design of personal \ncomputer training:\n1.\t We need to explain the reasons why specific things are being taught. \n2.\t Instruction should be task-oriented instead of promoting learning by rote; learning \nactivities should be in the context of common tasks to be performed.\n3.\t Instruction should take into account the wide range of different backgrounds of learners; \nlearning materials and activities should allow for different levels/types of previous \nexperience with computers.\n4.\t Since adults are self-directed, instruction should allow learners to discover knowledge \nfor themselves without depending on other people; guidance and help will be provided \nif the learner makes mistakes and asks for help.\nKnowles considered adult education as an excellent setting for civic learning, as \noccasions where people relate to and interact with each other and become useful laboratories \nof democracy and cooperation.\nKnowles stressed that adults need:\n\u2022\t a mature understanding of themselves, their needs, motivations, interests, capacities, \nand goals. They need to accept and respect themselves for what and who they are, while \nstriving to grow.\n\u2022\t an attitude of acceptance, love, and respect toward themselves and others. \nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n20\n\u2022\t to learn to distinguish between people and ideas, and to challenge ideas without judging \nthe person. \n\u2022\t to learn to live in the here and now, accepting the fact that change is the ever present \nreality and develop awareness and the capacity for learning from every experience.\n\u2022\t to learn to react to the causes, and not the symptoms of behavior. Have an understanding \nthat solutions to problems lie in their causes, not in their symptoms. \n\u2022\t to learn how to facilitate their growth and develop their potentialities. This will contribute \nto their wellbeing and benefit society. \n\u2022\t to actualize one\u2019s own potentials requires various relational skills, social, vocational, \ncivic, artistic, and the like. Effective education aims to facilitate learners\u2019 potentialities \nat the bio-psycho-social-spiritual levels.\nFurthermore, adults need to understand the essential values of human experience and be \nfamiliar with the heritage of knowledge, the great traditions of the world in which they live. \nThey should understand and respect the values that bind communities together.\nAdults need to understand social realities, be aware of them and be an active and mature \nagent of social change. \nKnowles stated that there is ample evidence that self-directed learning offers several \nadvantages: people who are proactive learners learn more and better than reactive learners; \npeople who passively wait to be taught \u201center into learning more purposefully and with \ngreater motivation. They also tend to retain and make use of what they learn better and longer \nthan do the reactive learners\u201d (Knowles 1975: 14).\nSelf-directed learning is more in tune with the natural processes of psychological \ndevelopment. \u201cAn essential aspect of maturing is developing the ability to take increasing \nresponsibility for our own lives\u2014to become increasingly self-directed\u201d (Knowles 1975: 15).\nThirdly, more and more educational programs have placed more responsibility on the \nlearners to be active learners: \u201cStudents entering into these programs without having learned \nthe skills of self-directed inquiry will experience anxiety, frustration, and often failure, and \nso will their teachers\u201d (Knowles 1975: 15).\nFurthermore, social reality has been changing at an accelerating pace; it is no longer \nrealistic to define the purpose of education as a mere transmission of what is known to new \n\u201cIt is no longer realistic to define the purpose of education as \na mere transmission of what is known to new generations. The \nmain purpose of education must now be to develop the skills of \ninquiry to learn how to learn.\u201d\nThe Need for Person-Centered Education\nAlberto Zucconi\n21\ngenerations. The main purpose of education must now be to develop the skills of inquiry to \nlearn how to learn.\nMalcolm Knowles proposed a five step model to promote student-centered adult learning:\n1.\t diagnosing learning needs.\n2.\t formulating learning needs.\n3.\t identifying human resources for learning.\n4.\t choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies.\n5.\t evaluating learning outcomes.\nKnowles was the first to chart the rise of the adult education movement in the United \nStates, the first to develop a statement of informal adult education practice and the first to \nattempt a comprehensive theory of adult education. He was an innovator and a key figure in \nadult education throughout the Western world in the XX century (Jarvis 1987: 185).\nThere are several barriers to the restructuring of the field of traditional education and \nthose barriers are to be identified, understood and resolved if the efforts to promote a more \neffective education are to be successful.\nThe goal is to improve our education system in order to be able to offer a more effective \neducation, an education based on reality, and which is scientifically grounded on how \npeople learn and develop their potentialities. We need to understand the obstacles and \ndefense mechanisms that impede change and why the factual politics of education are often \nincongruent with the declared educational goals. Do we have the political will to change \nobsolete education?\nJohn Dewey eloquently stated that the problem with education is that there are too many \nteachers and very few facilitators of learning.\nThe teachers\u2019 skills are socially construed, so to promote change effectively it is \ncounterproductive just to criticize teachers for being teacher-centered educators, since \nsociety trained them to be so. We need to retool teachers\u2019 education and promote change and \nundertake the training of traditional educators to make them motivated enough to become \neffective student-centered educators. This process needs to be a promotion of change on a \nwin-win basis. It would be quite incongruent not to consider educators as persons who need \nto be respected, understood and facilitated in their learning new skills as educators.\nWe need to understand how effectively learning of educators can be facilitated and how \ndecision makers can become part of the solution, not part of the problem as in obsolete \neducation.\nAnother way to be person/student-centered is to apply to the field of education the \nknowledge that is emerging from the advancement of research in neuroscience (Goswami, \n2004); (Blakemore & Frith, 2005); (Caine and Caine, 2011); (Brunnhuber, 2016). The \nemerging field of educational neuroscience is helping us better understand why person/\nstudent-centered education is effective; neuroscience research confirms that learning \nCADMUS\nVolume 3 - Issue 1, October 2016\n22\noutcomes are not solely determined by the environment, and that personal/biological factors \nare also significant variables. Therefore, in order to be effective, education needs to be \nperson-centered, respecting and valorizing individual differences. \nTaking the Person-Centered Approach Institute (IACP) as an example, the post-\ngraduate courses there are organized as a learning community where professors and students \nintentionally create a facilitative climate of learning and collaboratively strive to achieve \ncommon goals. Every day there is an encounter group and students can call for a community \nmeeting if they want to address any specific problem or issue.\nExams and assessments are not of the traditional kind: the students orally share in the \nclassroom their written self-evaluation focused on 3 levels of their learning experience: to \nknow, to learn to do and to be. They receive their peers\u2019 and the professors\u2019 feedback orally. \nIn addition, each professor and tutor receives feedback from the students. The secretaries and \nthe facilities are also evaluated by the students with the use of anonymous questionnaires that \nthe students are asked every time to improve or modify. Suggestions for improvements are \ngiven to each professor, tutor and secretary as well as to each facility. The feedback of the \nstudents is discussed in a staff meeting after which the  course director and the local IACP \nbranch director communicate to the students the changes and improvements that they are \nwilling and able to implement with the students\u2019 active involvement.   \nDuring written exams, the questions are distributed and at the end of the allotted time \nthe students are asked not to turn in their papers as is done in traditional education, but to \ntake them home and correct them by consulting the literature and then edit their answers if \nnecessary and send their papers to their tutor and professor.\nPromoting change cannot be done in a mechanistic reductionist way as Jasanoff (2011) \nreminds us. Different civic epistemologies shape different responses to anthropogenic \nchanges (Norgaard, 2011): the construction of public knowledge varies from culture \nto culture and from community to community, different epistemologies and different \nhermeneutics need to be kept in mind for the promotion of change because what may work \nin a community may not  be automatically effective in another.\nIn order to be effective, the new paradigm of education should avoid becoming a one \nway worldview. As it is important to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity, it is also important \nto protect human creativity and the plurality of narratives and cultures, all united in their \ncommon goal and effort to protect and respect all life forms. \nAuthor Contact Information\nEmail: alberto.zucconi@iacpedu.org\nBibliography\n1.\t\nAnderson, T.
