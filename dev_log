####workflow

There is a assets_list with all references (APA style) of the materials collected (/materials/assets_list)
There are 4 kinds of materials:
	papers
	webpages
	books
	other(pdf/doc)
the classify_materials function create sublists, one for each kind of material, and save it in the corrisponding folder
so we have
	books_references in /books
	other_resources_references in /other_resources
	article_references in /papers
	website_references in /webpages

we need to create algos to extract and clean the relevant information to then dump in a datbase.

#### structure of the data (papers)

	data = {
                        "_id": str(ObjectId()),
                        "journal_name",
                        "issue",
                        "title",
                        "authors",
                        "abstract",
                        "body",
                        "bibliography",
                        "keywords",
                        "publication_date",
                        "DOI",
                        "language",
                        "raw_text",
                        "targets": ["People", "Trainers", "Public Administration"]  # Example targets
                    }
	

#### structure

folders for different materials
	papers
	webpages
	books
	other(pdf/doc)

#### Log

created structure with folders for different materials
	papers: done for 1 journal, the problem is that I will have to do for all different journals
	webpages
	books
	other(pdf/doc)

Implemented the classify_materials function
	refined classifier, now create 4 lists, one for papers, one for books, one for website and one for other resources
implemented the paper_PDF_extractor
	implemnted the matching function:
		I believe the easiest way to extract relevant info is to match the reference with the paper and start from there. 
		There may be more efficient/better approaches (AI? like SpaCy?) but for the moment it works like that
	implemented the title and author extraction
	implemented part of the abstract extraction

Extract Journal from PDF (or a list of journals) -> this will be used to havedifferent function based on the journal structure
